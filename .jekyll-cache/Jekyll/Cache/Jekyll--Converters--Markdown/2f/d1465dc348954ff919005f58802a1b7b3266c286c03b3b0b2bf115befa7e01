<p><strong>Two new ebooks for October 2019!</strong></p>

<p><a href="/novels/the-sharpest-kiss/"><em>The Sharpest Kiss</em></a> and <a href="/novels/back-to-bite-you/"><em>Back to Bite You</em></a> are a two volume low-angst, non-epic paranormal romantic comedy featuring vampires.</p>

<p>This pair of short novels contain parts one and two of a complete story (although part one can be read as a stand-alone). They feature a cast of young characters (early to late twenties) living in the Houston suburbs when their normal, everyday existences are rudely intruded upon by a vicious member of the undead.</p>

<p>I don’t know about you, but I personally enjoy all different varieties of romance novels and vampire books (and donuts :)). These books in particular, I would characterize as “New Adult Paranormal Romantic Comedies,” or maybe “Romantic Horror Comedies.” They’re fun, light-hearted stories intended to be fairly quick reads, and which will hopefully entertain you, warm your heart, and leave a smile on your face.</p>
