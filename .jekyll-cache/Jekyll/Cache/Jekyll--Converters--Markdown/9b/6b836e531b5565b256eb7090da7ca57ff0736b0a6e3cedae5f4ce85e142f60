<p>The following is an excerpt from <a href="/novels/back-to-bite-you/"><em>Back to Bite You</em></a>, the sequel to <a href="/novels/the-sharpest-kiss/"><em>The Sharpest Kiss</em></a>.  As such, it contains spoilers for that story.</p>

<h4 id="chapter-one">Chapter One</h4>

<p><strong>“Okay, Nathan, let’s go over</strong> the plan for tonight. When the bad vampire shows up, <em>I’ll</em> throw a binding spell at it to
incapacitate it,” Jessica waved her hands, “and then <em>you’ll</em> jump in and do your thing—”</p>

<p>“What?” Nathan cuther off. “No. That is not going to happen. If a feral vampire makes an
appearance here tonight, you are staying in the car. I will handle it.”</p>

<p>Now it was Jessica’s turn to say, “What?”</p>

<p>“You heard me.”</p>

<p>“Then why am I
even here? You said I could come hunting with you.”</p>

<p>He looked at her
from the driver’s side of the car’s darkened interior, incredulity shading his
deep blue eyes. “I said you could come. I did not say you would be hunting. You
are here…for moral support.”</p>

<p>“Moral support? On
a <em>vampire hunt?</em> Really?”</p>

<p>“And for
companionship,” he said, and now his eyes gleamed as he looked her over, one
corner of his mouth twisting up in a smirk. “I enjoy your…company very much.”</p>

<p>A smile spread
across her lips. “Well, I enjoy yours, too. But I haven’t been training with
Kiefer and the girls all these weeks just so that I can sit around looking
pretty. I’ve got magic skills now, too, you know.” She waggled her fingers
again. “I can do cool stuff, see?” She held out her right hand and spoke a few
words, and a tiny blue flame flickered to life in the center of her palm.</p>

<p>It took a great
deal of effort for Jessica to hold the flame together, and to keep it from
dying out, but Nathan looked at it as if she’d done nothing more interesting
than strike a match.</p>

<p>“Cute,” he said.
“If the vampire needs you to light his cigarette, I will let you know.” And
then he leaned over and snuffed out her magical fire with his thumb and
forefinger. To really rub it in, he gave her a smug look and turned his
attention back to fiddling with his weapons bandolier, ensuring all of his
wooden stakes and scary knives were fastened to it securely.</p>

<p>Jessica made a disappointed
noise but didn’t argue anymore. She knew he was right, and she had only been
joking around with him, anyway. Although she <em>had</em> been training with Kiefer, Lucy, Dara, and Chloe a little, she
knew her magical “skills” were still puny at best. Unlike those other four,
Jessica didn’t have a lot of spare time in which to practice, nor did she seem
to possess an innate knack for the dark arts. Which was fine by her, really.
There were other things she was good at. Like tracking down obscure books and doing
hours of research.</p>

<p>And providing
companionship on stakeouts.</p>

<p>With a smile, she
glanced out the windshield at the Christmas lights illuminating the public park
Kiefer had assigned her and Nathan to watch tonight. She could see cars
circling around, their drivers searching for parking, and she spotted plenty of
regular people, families with children, wandering around with cups of hot cocoa
clutched in their gloved hands, as they goggled over the decorative lights and
stood in line to have their pictures taken with Santa. She saw no vampires,
however. For that, she was both grateful and disappointed. She was glad, of
course, that there weren’t any monsters popping out of the trees tonight,
harassing innocent folks just out for a night of holiday cheer. But at the same
time, Jessica knew there <em>were</em> vampires
out there somewhere, lurking around the city. She knew Nathan and the gang
needed to find them all and deal with them as soon as possible.</p>

<p>It had been over a
month since Dorian had let twenty-eight bloodsuckers loose in the area, and so
far, Jessica’s friends had caught only seventeen of them. Lucy and Aaron had
taken down three together, while Jason and Dara had nabbed four. Nathan, Chloe,
and Kiefer—either individually or in some combination together—had dealt with
the other ten. Every one of the vampires had been feral, and had needed to be
put down immediately. Reports of attacks continued to trickle in on a
semi-regular basis, however, letting the hunters know the rest of the vampires
were still out there, wreaking havoc. The thought kept Jessica up at night,
even though she knew she and the others were doing everything they could to
stop them. She had simply never been the most patient person, and she wished
they could just hurry up and find the despicable creatures already and end them
once and for all. Then they could move on to their next order of business,
which was finding and killing Nathan’s master, Marta. Once they’d managed that,
Nathan would be human again. He would finally think it was okay to be
romantically involved with Jessica. Not that he <em>wasn’t</em> already romantically involved with her. He was just
sometimes a little uptight about it.</p>

<p>She glanced at him
again and saw he had taken out a cloth and was polishing a gigantic,
lethal-looking serrated blade.</p>

<p>“I don’t think any
other vampires are going to be visiting us here tonight,” she said glumly.</p>

<p>“No,” he agreed.
“I fear you are correct.”</p>

<p>She paused a
moment and then said, cheerfully, “Hey, I’ve got an idea, though. Do you want
to make out with me?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said
immediately, but still didn’t look up.</p>

<p>“But you won’t,”
she sighed.</p>

<p>“You know I will
not.”</p>

<p>“You kissed me
that one time in my apartment,” she reminded him, “and it was really hot.”</p>

<p>“I remember,” he
assured her.</p>

<p>“Do you think it
was a mistake?”</p>

<p>“No. But it should
not happen again.”</p>

<p>“But it <em>has</em> happened again. A couple times since
then. Those were hot, too.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” he
sighed. “What can I say? You are extraordinarily beautiful, and…it makes me
weak.” She saw the corner of his mouth curling upward, and she moved in closer,
bringing her face nearer to his. “Jessica, move back,” he said, feigning
irritation. “You are blocking the light from the streetlamp.”</p>

<p>She reached out
and put her hand on his nape, running her fingers through the lush hair there.
He ignored it for a while, but then his hands stilled on the weapon, and he
turned to stare at her.</p>

<p>“Does that feel
good?” she asked, pitching her voice lower as she surveyed him coyly from
beneath her lashes.</p>

<p>“You know it
does.” He sheathed the blade and set it on the dashboard. And then his hand was
on <em>her</em> nape, and he was kissing her
like crazy, his lips moving expertly over hers and his tongue seeking entrance.
She gladly let him have it. The weapons bandolier, promptly forgotten, slipped
between the seats with a clatter. His arms went around her and, with a faint
growl, he dragged her against his chest.</p>

<p><em>Holy cow,</em> Jessica thought. This man—this
<em>vampire</em>—sure could kiss like a
champion. She felt her head growing light and fuzzy, her body going warm and
weak.</p>

<p>And then he bit
her.</p>

<p>Not on purpose. It
was just a quick slip of one of his fangs, nicking the tender swell of her
lower lip, but still, it stung like the dickens.</p>

<p>“Ah!” Jessica
gasped and pulled away.</p>

<p>Distress swam into
Nathan’s gaze, cutting through the clouds of lust that had gathered there. “I
apologize. It happens sometimes—”</p>

<p>“When you get
excited, I know.” Jessica reached for her mouth.</p>

<p>Nathan caught her
hand and moved it away, bringing his own thumb to her lip. He blotted the tiny
bead of blood that had arisen there and brought it to his mouth. Jessica saw
his eyes flicker as he swallowed.</p>

<p>“Do I taste good?”
she wondered.</p>

<p>“You do,” he said
simply. “But again, I am sorry.”</p>

<p>“Don’t apologize,”
she waved at him. “It’s cool. Hazards of dating a vampire.”</p>

<p>He actually smiled
at that, but he said, “We are not dating. I have told you many times, that will
not happen until I am human once again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, okay,” she
said in a skeptical tone. “Well, then what <em>are</em> we doing?”</p>

<p>He brought a
fingertip to the hollow of her throat, tracing slowly into her cleavage. “You
are being extraordinarily beautiful, as always. And I am once again being
weak.”</p>

<p>She grinned. And
then she leaned forward and kissed him again. He had just moaned, starting to
get back into it, when she nipped his bottom lip with her teeth.</p>

<p>“Ow,” he pulled
back, surprise flaring in his irises.</p>

<p>“There, let’s see
how you like it,” she sniped, but with the smile still in her eyes.</p>

<p>His irises
smoldered in response, and he took her by the arm to pull her in close again.
“Minx,” he said, and fixed his mouth to hers. A moment later, his hand was on
her chest, caressing her through the soft fabric of her sweater. He toyed with
the top button, and Jessica unfastened it for him. She knew he would never have
done it himself. As she had discovered over the past few weeks, “weak” for her
or not, Nathan was still a gentleman with a strict code of self-conduct. Maybe
a little too strict, as far as she was concerned. He might slip now and again,
and allow himself to kiss her, but he’d never venture any further. Little did
he know what a paradoxical effect his abstention had on her. His gallant
restraint was meant to cool the passion between them, but all it did was make
Jessica hotter for him. She could almost convince herself she was dating an
old-fashioned nobleman, or maybe a medieval knight. She’d never known how much
she liked it when a guy played hard to get.</p>

<p>Sinking her hands
into Nathan’s hair, she felt herself melting again, the desire to climb into
his lap and rip off his shirt almost overwhelming her. She might have tried
it—had the car’s back door not suddenly flown open and scared the living
daylights out of her.</p>

<p>“Ahhh!” Jessica and Nathan both cried out.</p>

<p>Chloe slid into
the backseat and slammed the door closed, using her telekinesis to secure all
the locks again. “I am sorry. I did not mean to startle you.”</p>

<p>“Chloe,” Jessica’s
hands flew up to refasten her sweater. She stared at the <em>nosferim</em>—Chloe’s term for a
vampire/human hybrid—in the backseat with alarm. “I thought we talked about you
sneaking up on people?”</p>

<p>Chloe looked at
her with big, innocent blue eyes. “I deliberately made noise as I approached.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, well, noisy
for a vampire and noisy for a human are two different things, I guess,” Jessica
huffed.</p>

<p>And that wasn’t
the only difference between them, either. As a hybrid, Chloe shared a few
characteristics with vampires, while lacking many others. She had a typical
human life expectancy. Sunlight didn’t harm her. She had retractable fangs, and
could subsist on blood, but chose not to. Crosses and holy water had no adverse
effect on her. She wasn’t particularly fast, but she had increased strength and
some psychic ability, including light telekinesis. Her biggest asset had
nothing to do with her heritage at all, though, but rather came from her
knowledge of magic and the supernatural in general. She’d spent the first few
years of her life in an undisclosed “village in Britain,” but had afterward
roamed the globe with her parents, her grandfather, and a revolving door of
other vampire hunters from around the world, tracking and destroying <em>nosferatu</em>, and honing her spellcraft.
Despite being only twenty-two years old, she was a proficient magic user and
experienced hunter. There was no denying she was impressive, but…she was also a
little odd. Even Chloe admitted it. She’d once told Jessica, with a sardonic
twist to her lips, that among her own family members, she was considered the
“most socially adept” of them. Hybrid vampires, it turned out, tended to be even
weirder in some ways than the full-blooded variety.</p>

<p>Chloe’s
expression, if one could call it that, didn’t change. She said, “If nothing
else, I thought you two would hear the door locks opening.”</p>

<p>Nathan grumbled,
“We were…preoccupied.”</p>

<p>“I noticed.” There
was no discernible judgment in Chloe’s tone. Her slim white hands came up to
straighten her impeccably fitted black leather jacket, which she wore over a
black turtleneck and black jeans. Black boots capped her feet. She looked like
a shadow with a white porcelain mask floating above it. “Once again, I
apologize. I just spotted you here and thought I would come by and say hello. I
did not realize Kiefer had assigned you to the park tonight, else I might have
chosen another location to surveil. Have the two of you had any luck here?”</p>

<p>“Well, <em>I</em> think I might’ve been about to get
lucky, if someone hadn’t rudely interrupted,” Jessica grumbled under her
breath.</p>

<p>Nathan shot her an
amused look before turning back to Chloe. “No,” he said, shaking his head.
“Despite two attacks having previously been reported in this park, we have seen
nothing. Not a single feral vampire. You?”</p>

<p>Chloe shook her
head, too. “Those reports from Frankie came in weeks ago,” she reminded him.
“It seems the vampires we seek have moved on from here. I doubt they will
return.”</p>

<p>“You think they’re
gone?” Jessica asked. “That they’ve left the city?”</p>

<p>“No,” Chloe said.
“I believe the majority of them are holed up somewhere in the area, but it is
anyone’s guess where their lair might be.”</p>

<p>“I tend to believe
you are right,” Nathan admitted thoughtfully. “If only we did not live in such
a sprawling metropolis; it might be easier to pinpoint their location.”</p>

<p>“I do have some
good news,” Chloe offered, sitting forward. “The earlier part of the day proved
more fruitful for Kiefer and myself. Before sunset, we found one of the strays
slumbering in a cemetery across town.”</p>

<p>Jessica and Nathan
exchanged an excited glance. “No kidding,” Jessica grinned. “That’s great!”</p>

<p>Nathan was more
subdued. “It was feral, I presume? Like the others?”</p>

<p>Chloe nodded.</p>

<p>“You killed it?”
Jessica gulped. She knew it was the right thing to do. As their appellation
suggested, feral vampires were wild. They couldn’t be reasoned with. If left
alone, they would go on a rampage, biting and killing until they were finally
dispatched by a stake through the heart or a blade through the neck. Still,
Jessica could never forget that four of the men she knew and respected most
these days—Nathan, Kiefer, Jason, and Aaron—had all
been turned into vampires once upon a time. One of them—the one she was
head-over-heels in love with—was still as undead as the day was long. The feral
vampires they now hunted had once been normal people, too, with families and
hopes and dreams. It just didn’t feel like much of a triumph to have to put
them down like dogs.</p>

<p>But then Chloe
said something that startled Jessica out of her gloomy thoughts. “It is not
dead.”</p>

<p>“What?” Jessica
glanced at Nathan and saw he was surprised, too.</p>

<p>“What happened to
it?” he asked. “It escaped you?” Jessica could practically see the gears
turning in his head, as he sought to formulate some plan with which to track
down the vampire again, and this time to subdue it for good.</p>

<p>But Chloe gave
another shake of her head, causing a golden curl to spring loose from her
ponytail.</p>

<p>“Where is it?”
Jessica asked.</p>

<p>“Perhaps…” Chloe
hesitated, measuring her words with care. “Perhaps it would be best if the two
of you returned to the safehouse with me and saw for yourselves.”</p>

<h4 id="chapter-two">Chapter Two</h4>

<p>Jessica had
initially heard of Kiefer’s safehouse nearly two months ago, when she’d first
met Nathan’s magic-using best friend. At the time, the sorcerer hadn’t trusted
anyone but Nathan enough to allow them there, but circumstances had changed
since then. Once Jessica and her friends had earned his confidence, Kiefer had
thrown open the doors to his haven and revealed to them many of its hidden
secrets. The group of friends had now spent weeks training down there, as well
as plotting against Dorian and his feral vampires.</p>

<p>The place had
turned out to be a four-bedroom family home situated in the woods outside the
city. Kiefer had purchased it for a song, years ago, and then spent more than a
decade renovating and reinforcing it, creating what he considered a “fortress
against evil” that was both practical and cozy. The surface level was furnished
and outfitted just like any other normal, modern home, but the real essence of
the place existed underground, where a honeycomb of concrete bunkers spread
beneath the bulk of the entire property.</p>

<p>According to
Kiefer, the estate’s previous owner had been a doomsday “prepper” who had built
the catacombs in anticipation of Armageddon. Or perhaps Ragnarök.
The man’s rambling conspiracy theories hadn’t been totally clear to him. He
knew only that the grumpy, disheveled seller had since decided the location was
too risky, being so close to the fourth most populous city in the country, and
therefore a natural target for terrorists. Or angry gods. He had off-loaded the
house to Kiefer without asking too many tricky questions, and then quickly
shambled off to someplace quieter and more remote. Now Kiefer used the
subterranean shelter to house not only food and supplies but also weapons,
books, computers, and ingredients for spellcraft.
Rooms at the north end were reserved for training and storage, and it was to
one of these gymnasiums that Jessica now followed Nathan.</p>

<p>“What is this?”
Nathan was staring at an enormous cage looming in the corner. The cage had
always been there—precisely why, Jessica had always been afraid to ask—but it
was usually empty. Not tonight, though.</p>

<p>Kiefer stepped
forward with his hands raised. “Now, before you freak out,” he said, but
Nathan’s face had already begun to cloud over, his eyes turning stormy.</p>

<p>“What is going on
here?” he demanded.</p>

<p>Jessica could
understand why he was upset. The scene before them was…well, more than a little
disturbing. A female vampire, barefoot and clad in dirty rags, slumped in a
corner of the cage with an iron collar clapped around her neck. Shackles
encircled her wrists and ankles. The creature appeared crazed, her teeth bared
and her eyes rolling wildly, but her restraints must have been enchanted,
because she looked frozen from the neck down, her arms and legs limp.</p>

<p>Nathan turned to
Chloe, who had entered right behind them. “This was your idea, wasn’t it?” he
accused her.</p>

<p>Chloe’s face
remained impassive, and though she opened her mouth to respond, Kiefer beat her
to it.</p>

<p>“Actually, it was
mine.”</p>

<p>Nathan spun back
to him. “What?”</p>

<p>Kiefer’s hands
were still in the air, as though he were surrendering. “It <em>was</em> sparked by something Chloe said to me, though.”</p>

<p>Nathan’s eyes
narrowed. He muttered under his breath, “I knew it.”</p>

<p>Jessica examined
Chloe, searching for a reaction to Nathan’s distrust of her, which still
lingered—and clearly ran deep—even after weeks of his being acquainted with
her. But the vampire hybrid remained as inexpressive as ever, her face
unchanged.</p>

<p>Kiefer said, “I
knew you wouldn’t like it, man, but hear me out. You know Chloe’s got decent
psychic powers. She thinks she might be able to read one of the feral’s minds. Then we might be able to figure out what
Dorian was doing with them, and what he wanted with Celia. And why he wanted
you so bad, too. You still want to find all of that out, don’t you?”</p>

<p>Jessica could see
Nathan’s skepticism fading as he considered these possibilities. Because of
course he wanted the answers to those questions. They had haunted him for over
a month now. He rounded on Chloe. “Do you honestly believe you could perform
such a procedure? Is it even possible?”</p>

<p>Chloe stood with
her long legs apart and her hands behind her back. “It is possible, and in
fact, I have already attempted it. I did not succeed, but I think perhaps under
the correct circumstances, I might attain more satisfactory results.”</p>

<p>“What
circumstances?”</p>

<p>Chloe cast an
imperturbable look at the vampire in the cage. “She must be starved for several
days, and there is a ritual that must be performed. It would involve
ritualistic cutting and binding—”</p>

<p>“No,” Nathan said
before she could finish.</p>

<p>“Nathan,” Kiefer
tried, but Nathan swung his turbulent gaze toward him and held up his index
finger.</p>

<p>“I have read about
the sorts of rituals of which you speak,” he said to Chloe. “The subject must
be awake throughout the ordeal, correct? With no anesthetic magic administered
to dampen her pain?”</p>

<p>“Of course not,”
Chloe said. “Pain is a necessary ingredient to the procedure. It is what will
break the vampire’s spirit and make it docile, pliable enough that it will open
up its mind to me.”</p>

<p>“Then what you are
describing is torture,” Nathan said through gritted teeth, “and I will not
allow it. Kiefer should have known that. In fact, I am certain that he did.”</p>

<p>Kiefer started to
say something, but Nathan glared at him, and he shut up.</p>

<p>“Now, one of you
put this poor creature out of its misery,” Nathan ordered. “This instant.”</p>

<p>“I do not
understand, Nathan.” Chloe inclined her head thoughtfully. “This creature is
beyond reason. It is bestial. And you planned to kill it anyway. What
difference could a few days of discomfort prior to its demise possibly make to
you?”</p>

<p>The words were
hardly out of her mouth before Nathan yanked a stake from his belt and flung it
into the cage. The wooden point found its target, burying itself in the
vampire’s heart, and the creature scarcely had time to hiss one last time
before she dissolved into a pile of ashes. Her shackles and collar tumbled to
the floor with a dismal <em>clank.</em></p>

<p>Kiefer’s face
fell, and Chloe sighed as she dropped her chin. “I wish you had not done that,”
she said to Nathan. “It was no easy matter getting that vampire here and
restraining her thus.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry for
your inconvenience,” Nathan replied sarcastically.</p>

<p>Chloe eyed him
coolly. She took a step forward. “Nathan, when I first came to you, it was to
ask for your help hunting a master, Gregor, who had long eluded me in the
Himalayas. You told me you would help me find him, but only after you’d located
and dealt with every stray vampire Dorian had let loose here in your city.
I agreed your focus should remain here, given the dire circumstances, and I
offered to aid you in your pursuit. Then you informed me that even if you found
all of Dorian’s vagrants, you would not be free to help me until after you had
tracked down your own master, Marta, and dispatched her to regain your
humanity. I found this rather disappointing, as you would obviously be a more
useful partner to me in your vampiric form, but even so…I strove to understand
your motivations and, again, offered you my help. I thought perhaps eliminating
these vampires alongside you would give you and Kiefer and the others a chance
to get to know me better, and to see that you all could trust me.” She shifted
her shoulders, straightening her neck. “But now we have been hunting these
strays for weeks and, meanwhile, the trail for Gregor grows colder and colder…”</p>

<p>“As I said,”
Nathan ground out at her, “I am sorry you have been inconvenienced. But it was
your choice to stay and help us, Chloe. There is nothing holding you here,
should you desire to leave. By all means, if you feel so compelled, go and hunt
this other master down—on your own.”</p>

<p>Chloe watched him
for a moment, contemplating. “Nathan, I know my recent report to you about
Marta was difficult for you to hear, and that you have taken it badly. But that
is no reason to let emotion cloud your judgment on other matters.”</p>

<p>Now Nathan
scowled. He used his super-speed to get in Chloe’s face, and he curled his hand
around her throat. Jessica could see he wasn’t putting any real pressure behind
his gesture, but the <em>nosferim</em>’s
head jerked back, and she stared at Nathan with slightly widened eyes.</p>

<p>“This is not about
Marta, Chloe,” he seethed. “It is about the way we do things around here, and
how that does not include kidnapping and torture.” He paused, considering the
girl’s face before adding with a small sneer, “And if this is your attempt at earning
my trust—by sneaking around behind my back and breaking my rules—then allow me
to inform you, you are going about it in <em>entirely the wrong manner.</em>” He
dropped his hand from her throat and stalked past her, out the door.</p>

<p>Everyone else
stood perfectly still in the wake of his exit. “Well,” Kiefer finally broke the
awkward silence, “that could have gone better.”</p>

<p>Jessica flashed
him a cringing smile. “He’s, uh…I think he’s a little tired tonight,” she
offered feebly. Then she turned and followed after her boyfriend, trotting to
keep up with his long, angry strides.</p>
