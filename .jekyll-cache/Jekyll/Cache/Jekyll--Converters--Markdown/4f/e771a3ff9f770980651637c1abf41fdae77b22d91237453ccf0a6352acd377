<h4 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h4>

<p>When I was in high school, I spent a lot of time hanging out at a Laundromat. I know that sounds weird, but hear me out. It wasnâ€™t just any Laundromat. It was called Lynchâ€™s and the old guy who owned it, Roy Connor, had bought the coffee shop next door to it, cut a door between the two spaces, and turned the place into one giant, Laundromat-slash-coffee-shop hybrid. Then heâ€™d installed some video games, put in a couple of pool tables, and built a stage in the back so all the local punk bands could play there on the weekends.</p>

<p>Roy had done all this because his youngest son, Scott, had been in a bunch of those local bands, himselfâ€”until heâ€™d been killed by a drunk driver on his way home from his job at the Maribel Movie Palace one night. Roy had opened Lynchâ€™s in Scottâ€™s honor, and it hadnâ€™t taken long for all of Scottâ€™s old friends (and some of us whoâ€™d barely even known him) to start hanging out there all the time. Royâ€™s granddaughter, April, made the best grilled cheese sandwiches in the world. I heard Royâ€™s coffee was great, too, but I wouldnâ€™t know. I was hooked on caffeine but was more of a diet soda addictâ€¦</p>

<p>â€œVee?â€ My best friend, Lia, was snapping her fingers in front of my face. â€œHello? Vee? Are you awake or what? Iâ€™ve been asking you for another flier for about the last five minutes.â€</p>

<p>My best friend and I were standing by the light pole at the corner of Main Street and Carreen College Avenue. The wind was whipping Liaâ€™s auburn hair all around her head and she was frowning at me with her arms crossed.</p>

<p>â€œSorry,â€ I said, holding out a flier, â€œI was just thinking about Lynchâ€™s. How lame itâ€™ll be if all this doesnâ€™t work and Roy has to shut the place downâ€¦â€</p>

<p>Two weeks ago weâ€™d learned that although Roy owned the building, a new owner had raised rent on the land Lynchâ€™s occupied. Royâ€™d been falling behind on the payments for a while. If he couldnâ€™t come up with the money to cover what he owed, the place would close in a matter of months, maybe sooner. Liaâ€™d rushed to organize the â€œSave Lynchâ€™sâ€ benefit show we were hanging the fliers for, but I was worried it was too little too late.</p>

<p>â€œThat is not going to happen,â€ said Lia, snatching the flier away from me, â€œThis is going to work. It has to. Now hand me the stapler.â€</p>

<p>I dug the stapler out of my backpack and handed it over. Lia went to town on the flier, putting about ten staples in it to make sure the wind didnâ€™t rip it off the light pole. Then she turned and marched up the sidewalk toward Lynchâ€™s. I struggled after her, dripping with sweat because the afternoon sun was beating down on us, and because my backpack was stuffed with paper. Along with the fliers, I was also hauling around what felt like fifty pounds of pages for the latest issue of Liaâ€™s zine, The Blank Slate.</p>

<p>â€œNow remember,â€ Lia told me when we reached Lynchâ€™s grimy glass door, â€œnone of this gloom-and-doom talk in front of Roy, okay? Heâ€™s old. His heart canâ€™t take the stress.â€</p>

<p>I swept my sweaty hair back from my forehead. â€œHeâ€™s not that old. And his heartâ€™s perfectly fine.â€</p>

<p>â€œJust watch your mouth, okay?â€</p>

<p>A bell jingled as Lia pushed open the door. A blessedly cool, air-conditioned breeze wafted by us, carrying along the mingled scents of fried food and detergent, and we were met by a host of familiar sights: two lumpy, mismatched couches pushed against the wall beneath the front picture window, two billiard tables sitting side by side in front of them, and a gumball machine and Mortal Kombat cabinet flanking either side of the door leading into the coffee shop. Beyond the pool tables sat a bank of yellow, coin-operated clothes dryers and two rows of matching washing machines, lined up back to back. A thin old man in thick glasses waited next to one for his laundry. Apart from the thunder of his washing machine entering the spin cycle, the place was quiet. I wondered if Lia was right, and weâ€™d actually be able to save all of this. Or if the bizarre jumble of objects crowding Lynchâ€™s would soon get carted off to the flea market theyâ€™d most likely come from in the first place.</p>

<p>â€œHey girls.â€ Roy waddled up to the coffee shopâ€™s order window, wiping his stout fingers on a dishrag. â€œWhatâ€™re you up to?â€</p>

<p>â€œWallpapering College Avenue with fliers for the benefit,â€ Lia said as we neared him. â€œEveryone in townâ€™s going to show up and throw money at you, Roy, you just wait and see.â€</p>

<p>April appeared beside Roy, her hot pink hair knotted into two buns that stuck out on either side of her head like Mickey Mouse ears. â€œOoh, lemme see one,â€ she said, poking her horn-rimmed glasses up the bridge of her nose.</p>

<p>Lia took another flier out of my bag and handed it to her. While the Connors looked it over, she craned her neck to look into the coffee shop. â€œGreat,â€ she whispered to me, â€œcheck out whoâ€™s here.â€</p>

<p>I looked and saw a curvy blonde in a t-shirt and denim cut-offs standing inside, in the corner. She was surrounded by a cluster of guys who all seemed to have lost the ability to keep their tongues in their mouths. The girlâ€™s back was to us, but I knew exactly who she was. Paige Foster. The new girl. The one every guy from school was suddenly gaga over, and also the person Lia had just talked into joining our new band. If everything went as planned, the three of usâ€”and whoever we found to play guitarâ€”would be playing the Lynchâ€™s benefit together in just over a month.</p>

<p>â€œMaybe she wonâ€™t see us,â€ I said, rubbing and stretching my tired shoulder.</p>

<p>â€œWe should be so lucky,â€ said Lia.</p>

<p>â€œThis artwork looks awesome, Veronica,â€ April declared, smiling with approval at the flier.</p>

<p>â€œNice work, darlinâ€™,â€ Roy agreed.</p>

<p>â€œThanks,â€ I said.</p>

<p>â€œIâ€™m starved,â€ Lia said to me. â€œYou want anything?â€</p>

<p>I shook my head, shifting the backpack around on my shoulders. â€œThis is really heavy,â€ I complained to Lia. â€œI really just want to go sit down.â€</p>

<p>â€œThen go sit down,â€ she said.</p>

<p>I peeked into the coffee shop again, where I saw Paige flipping her long, blond hair over her shoulder. She said something that was obviously hilarious, making the guys standing around her all crack up in unison.</p>

<p>â€œDonâ€™t be scared,â€ Lia told me.</p>

<p>â€œIâ€™m not scared.â€</p>

<p>â€œShe seems pretty absorbed. She probably wonâ€™t even see you, like you said. And Iâ€™ll be right behind you as soon as I get my food.â€</p>

<p>I stepped into the coffee shop, trying to find a seat as far away from Paige and her gaggle of admirers as possible. I chose a salvaged picnic table carved up with graffiti pushed up against the wall. It was situated right under the Wild at Heart section of the David Lynch movie mural Roy had had his artist son, Brendanâ€”Aprilâ€™s fatherâ€”paint along the walls because Scott had been a huge fan.</p>

<p>With a sigh of relief, I let the backpack slide down my arm and land on the table with a thump. I collapsed on the bench and took all the fliers and zine pages out of the bag, arranging them in neat little piles on the picnic table. â€œSAVE LYNCHâ€™S!â€ shouted this monthâ€™s photocopied cover of The Blank Slate. We were charging two dollars, double our usual price, for this issue because one hundred percent of the proceeds would go directly to benefit Roy and his restaurant. â€œSure hope it helps,â€ I muttered under my breath. Then I got to work assembling the zine.</p>

<p>â€œYou know, Montez, if you guys really wanted to help Roy save this dump, youâ€™d focus on the band.â€</p>

<p>Iâ€™d been working for about five minutes when I looked up to see Paige putting one tan, shapely leg at a time over the bench across from mine. â€œThe showâ€™ll pull in way more money than that crappy zine ever will.â€ She plunked a coffee mug down on the table, eyeing the photocopies spread out between us with contempt.</p>

<p>â€œOkay,â€ I said, folding a photocopy in half. I didnâ€™t want to argue with her, but it was a stretch at this point for Paige, Lia, and I to even call ourselves a band. Weâ€™d only written four songs and hadnâ€™t come up with a name yet, much less played any gigs.</p>

<p>â€œIâ€™ll grant you we donâ€™t sound so good yet,â€ she said. â€œMostly because you canâ€™t play for shit.â€</p>

<p>â€œGee, thanks,â€ I said.</p>

<p>â€œBut Liaâ€™s decent,â€ she went on, â€œAnd with a lot of practice, you could probably get up to speed. Itâ€™s just too bad we lost Sierra.â€</p>

<p>I had to agree with her on that last part. The most recent fight sheâ€™d gotten into had prompted our guitarist, Sierraâ€™s, parents to send her away for a while. For now they werenâ€™t letting her out of the house and when the new semester started in a week, sheâ€™d be shipped off to some rebellious-teen boot camp up in Arkansas. Finding a replacement for her would probably take time. Time we didnâ€™t have.</p>

<p>I glanced toward the lunch counter, hoping to see Lia on her way to the table so I wouldnâ€™t have to deal with Paige all on my own, but she didnâ€™t seem to be in any hurry to come help me. She was settled comfortably on one of the duct taped vinyl barstools, swinging her Doc Martens against the chrome rungs and chattering away to Roy and April while they cooked her order. I turned back to my folding.</p>

<p>â€œHave you talked to anyone?â€ I asked Paige. â€œI mean anyone who might be able to take Sierraâ€™s place?â€ But she wasnâ€™t paying attention to me anymore.</p>

<p>â€œHey Dustin!â€ she called past me, waving.</p>

<p>I tucked my hair behind my ears and sat up straighter just as Dustin Tran strode up and stopped beside the table. â€œWhatâ€™s up?â€ he asked, jutting his chin at us. The wind had whipped his black, stick-straight hair into a snarled mess. He worked his fingers through it, trying to disentangle it.</p>

<p>â€œWe were just discussing the zineâ€™s crapitude,â€ I said dryly. â€œWanna help me put together the new issue?â€</p>

<p>His dark eyes glanced over the zine pages. He worried his lip ring with his tongue. Then he slid in beside me, resting his knee against mine under the table. â€œWhatâ€™s so bad about the zine?â€ he asked, squeezing my thigh once before picking up my stapler.</p>

<p>â€œEvery issueâ€™s the same,â€ answered Paige before I could say anything. â€œBlank Fiction this, Blank Fiction that. â€˜Blank Fiction is the best band in the whole wooorld.â€™â€</p>

<p>I pushed folded pages in Dustinâ€™s direction. â€œNot every issue,â€ I said, even though she was right. Blank Fiction was Liaâ€™s favorite band and favorite topic to write about. Even the zineâ€™s title referred to them.</p>

<p>â€œWho even cares about Blank Fiction anymore?â€ She looked up at the wall where a framed seven inch vinyl copy of Blank Fictionâ€™s first single hung between â€œLulaâ€ and â€œSailorâ€ from Wild at Heart. â€œSure, they were hot shit for a while. But they havenâ€™t put an album out in what, three years?â€</p>

<p>â€œAnd the last two kinda sucked,â€ added Dustin, stapling.</p>

<p>I stopped in mid-fold to give him a Look.</p>

<p>â€œWell, they did,â€ he said.</p>

<p>â€œMaybe you guys should branch out a little with your material?â€ said Paige, â€œcover something relevant for a change?â€</p>

<p>I was about to point out that, for her information, most of the stories in the latest issue werenâ€™t about Blank Fiction at all, but about Lynchâ€™sâ€”including a very up-to-the-minute piece on the placeâ€™s current financial woesâ€”when Paige knocked over her mug. It rolled across the table and coffee dregs spewed out of it, spattering the zine pages.</p>

<p>â€œHey, watch it!â€ I shouted, half-standing and lunging across the table to whisk the pages out of the way.</p>

<p>â€œOops,â€ said Paige, covering her mouth with her hand. â€œLooks like I need a refill. Be right back!â€</p>

<p>As she got up and swished away, I sat back, hugging the salvaged pages to my chest. Dustin reached across me to pluck a handful of napkins from the dispenser at the end of the table. â€œThat was close.â€</p>

<p>â€œIâ€™ll bet she did that on purpose,â€ I said. â€œSheâ€™s such a jerk.â€</p>

<p>Dustin mopped halfheartedly at the spill, straining his neck to watch Paige go. â€œI dunno. I kinda like her. Sheâ€™s feisty.â€</p>

<p>â€œThat what you call that?â€ I squinted at him, not liking the way his eyes lingered on Paigeâ€™s retreating figure.</p>

<p>Lia finally headed back over to the table, a soda cup in one hand and a red plastic basket overflowing with grilled cheese and French fries in the other.</p>

<p>â€œMan, that windâ€™s really picking up,â€ she said, putting the basket down. She sipped the soda through a straw just as a violent gust rattled the window behind the lunch counter. I pictured the fliers weâ€™d put up earlier hurtling away down the street.</p>

<p>â€œWhat happened here?â€ Lia picked up a zine cover speckled with light brown stains. The coffee had puckered the paper and smeared the photo copy ink.</p>

<p>â€œPaige happened,â€ I huffed.</p>

<p>â€œItâ€™s just a little coffee,â€ Dustin smiled at Lia, â€œIt was an accident. Donâ€™t worry, the stains just make it look more punk rock.â€</p>

<p>Lia wasnâ€™t having it. When Paige reappeared with her refilled mug, Lia waved the damaged sheet of paper in her face.â€Youâ€™ll have to pay for this, you know.â€</p>

<p>Paige didnâ€™t answer. She snatched a fry from Liaâ€™s basket and popped it into her mouth.</p>

<p>â€œI mean it,â€ said Lia. â€œWeâ€™re out two bucks for this.â€ She tossed the sheet back to me. â€œAnd you know Roy needs every cent he can get.â€</p>

<p>Paige leisurely licked salt from her fingertips and then sat down and blew into her coffee. â€œSo bill me,â€ she smirked.</p>

<p>Lia didnâ€™t reply. My best friend usually didnâ€™t back down from anyone, but I knew Paige scared her a little. Weâ€™d heard sheâ€™d stabbed someone back in Dallas and done a stint in juvie. All Paige had told us was her parents had moved her here a couple of months ago, hoping she wouldnâ€™t get into as much trouble in her motherâ€™s hometown as she had in the city, so we didnâ€™t know if the stabbing story was true. I wouldnâ€™t have been surprised to learn it was, though. There was just something creepy about her; a weird, wicked gleam she got in her green eyes sometimes.</p>

<p>The guys Paige had been talking to earlier had cleared out, leaving the room empty except for us. As our table fell silent, every other sound seemed too loud to me: the wind whipping faster and faster past the windows; Roy and April cleaning up the kitchen; Dustin stapling another zine together. â€œUm, what were you talking to Roy about just now?â€ I asked Lia, desperate to break the quiet.</p>

<p>Like the front room, Lynchâ€™s dining room was entirely outfitted from flea market and garage sale leftovers, so nothing matched. Lia took one of a variety of chairs away from another table, dragged it up beside mine and Dustinâ€™s picnic bench and sat in it backwards. â€œClyde,â€ she said, taking a bite of her sandwich. â€œHe wanted to know if my momâ€™s heard anything about him.â€</p>

<p>â€œHas she?â€ I asked.</p>

<p>Lia paused, chewing. â€œI dunno. I havenâ€™t asked her in a while. Sheâ€™s been really high strung lately, saying sheâ€™s so busy with the party and everythingâ€¦she sort of flipped out the last time I bugged her about it, so I decided to give it a rest. For now.â€</p>

<p>Clyde Kameron sang for Blank Fiction. He wasnâ€™t the biggest name in rock music or anything, but he was Carreen, Texasâ€™s principal claim to fame. Eight years ago, heâ€™d gone to Carreen High, like we did now. Heâ€™d dropped out in tenth grade, when his band had gotten signed. Heâ€™d left town, and although heâ€™d dumped the other two original members of Blank Fiction pretty soon after that, the bandâ€™s new incarnation had earned Clyde two gold recordsâ€”forcing my mom to stop telling me high school drop outs never amounted to anything. His brush with national fame mightâ€™ve fizzled out a few years back, but most everyone in Carreen under age thirty still loved Clyde at least a little because of what he represented: the hometown kid made good. Looking at him made people think they could do what heâ€™d done. It gave them hope.</p>

<p>Lia, though, was completely crazy about him.</p>

<p>Late last year, the Carreen College Museum had announced a planned exhibit honoring area musicians and Liaâ€™d led an aggressive campaign to get Clyde in. The museum hadnâ€™t wanted to feature anyone â€œcontemporaryâ€ (read: cool) but, due to a considerable show of public support, had grudgingly agreed to include Clyde and invited him to appear at the exhibitâ€™s dedication. So far he hadnâ€™t accepted. Liaâ€™d been hounding her mother, who was on one of the museumâ€™s fundraising committees, for news about his possible appearance for months. Thereâ€™d been no word.</p>

<p>â€œI figure the museumâ€™s gotta hear from him really soon, though,â€ Lia continued. â€œI mean, the dedicationâ€™s set for September fourth.â€</p>

<p>â€œThatâ€™s the day of the benefit,â€ Dustin remarked.</p>

<p>â€œDuh,â€ said Lia. â€œWhy do you think I scheduled the show for then?â€ When Dustin just stared at her blankly, she elaborated slowly, as though talking to a four year old: â€œIf Clydeâ€™s gonna be in town for the dedication anyway, thereâ€™s no reason he canâ€™t stop by the benefit, too; maybe play a song or two to help us out?â€</p>

<p>Paige snorted with laughter.</p>

<p>Lia turned to her. â€œSomething funny?â€</p>

<p>Paigeâ€™s wide mouth spread in a condescending smile. â€œPlease,â€ she said, â€œYouâ€™re deluded if you think Clyde Kameron is ever coming back to Carreen, much less playing here.â€</p>

<p>â€œThis is his hometown,â€ said Lia.</p>

<p>Paige ran a fingertip around the rim of her mug. â€œYeah, and he doesnâ€™t seem to give a ratâ€™s ass what goes on here anymore.â€</p>

<p>She had a point. Clyde hadnâ€™t been back once since heâ€™d left, and had never so much as mentioned his hometown in any interview Iâ€™d seen. It was as if heâ€™d forgotten all about Carreen the minute heâ€™d gotten out. Not that I could say I blamed him. I mean, Carreen was my home and I liked it well enough, but I knew most people couldnâ€™t wait to get out of here.</p>

<p>â€œAnd why should he?â€ Paige continued, voicing my thought. â€œI wonâ€™t either, once I get the hell out of this shit-hole and escape back to civilization.â€</p>

<p>Liaâ€™s grey eyes flashed in anger. I could tell she wanted to kick Paigeâ€™s ass all the way back to Dallas right then and there, but she stayed in her seat. Instead of ripping into Paige, she tore into a French fry, ripping it up into greasy little bits and squashing them to a pulp between her fingers. I caught her eye and gave her a weak smile, trying to be supportive. Iâ€™d never had the heart to tell her even I didnâ€™t think it was likely Clyde would ever be back, no matter how many awards the town offered him.</p>

<p>Paige ignored the drop-dead look Lia was giving her and turned her attention to Dustin. â€œSo, Tran,â€ she said, playing with a lock of her hair, â€œWhatâ€™s going on with you?â€</p>

<p>Dustin wiggled his lip ring with his tongue again. â€œNothinâ€™.â€</p>

<p>â€œI hear youâ€™re the local pool champ,â€ she said, â€œThe man to beat.â€</p>

<p>â€œI do alright,â€ he shrugged.</p>

<p>Paige stood up and came around to our side of the table. She stood right next to Dustin, the crotch of her too-tight shorts just inches from his face. â€œProve it,â€ she told him.</p>

<p>â€œWhat, you mean like, now?â€ he said, staring up at her.</p>

<p>â€œNo, next Tuesday,â€ she said. â€œYeah, now.â€</p>

<p>April had emerged from behind the counter to refill sugar containers and was standing at the table right beside ours. â€œUse the back pool table,â€ she instructed Paige, popping her bubble gum. â€œThe front oneâ€™s jammed. It keeps taking everyoneâ€™s money.â€</p>

<p>Dustin dropped the stapler without even glancing at me. He jumped to his feet, splaying his fingers against Paigeâ€™s lower back, just above the curve of her ample behind. â€œYouâ€™re on,â€ he said and steered her into the game room.</p>

<p>â€œNo way,â€ said Lia as they left. â€œYou donâ€™t think theyâ€™re gonna, you know, hook up-?â€ Of course I did. A girl playing pool with Dustin Tran only ever led to one thing. I should know.</p>

<p>â€œWhatever,â€ I said, a knot forming in my stomach.</p>

<p>I glanced over to where April stood with a sugar shaker in her hand, looking pityingly at me. Even â€œHenryâ€ from Eraserhead, peering wide eyed over her shoulder, seemed to say heâ€™d told me so. I looked away again.</p>

<p>â€œSee the way she looked at you when you told her sheâ€™d have to pay for that zine?â€ I asked Lia, scratching the side of my nose.</p>

<p>â€œI know. Sheâ€™s such a psycho. If she werenâ€™t, like, the only decent bass player we could get on such short noticeâ€¦â€ She bit another fry in half and gestured at the zine pages. â€œYou know what? Forget her. Letâ€™s just finish this and get out of here before that dirt storm gets any worse.â€</p>

<pre style="text-align:center;">***</pre>

<p>Half an hour later, Lia and I dropped a stack of fliers and twenty-four copies of the zine at the lunch counter. As usual, we kept the twenty-fifth issue of the Slate to mail off to Clyde Kameron himself, along with a handwritten fan letter from Lia taped to the inside cover. Borrowing a felt tip pen from April, Lia scratched Clydeâ€™s address, care of his management company, onto the back of the zine and stuck a few stamps in the corner.</p>

<p>We said goodbye to the Connors and went into the game room, where Dustin and Paige stood together beside the back pool table. Their game, if theyâ€™d ever started one, had been abandoned. Smoke snaked away from the end of a lit cigarette in Dustinâ€™s hand and I focused on the patterns it made as it drifted to the ceiling. So I wouldnâ€™t have to watch him put his tongue in Paigeâ€™s mouth.</p>

<p>Outside, the storm was dying down but hadnâ€™t completely abated. We crossed the street so Lia could drop Clydeâ€™s copy of The Blank Slate into the battered mailbox on the corner. As we hurried back to Lynchâ€™s parking lot, I shielded my face against the wind. It didnâ€™t help; I wound up with stinging eyes and a mouthful of grit anyway.</p>

<p>â€œYou going to be okay?â€ Lia asked me when we were safely in her front seat. The wind howled and buffeted the car. Knowing what she wanted to hear, I said I was fine and pretended my eyes were just watering because of the dirt in them.</p>

<h4 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h4>

<p>My mother was at work and I was home alone when Lia called me the next day. I told her I didnâ€™t feel like hanging out. When she insisted on coming over anyway, I told her Iâ€™d leave the front door unlocked so she could let herself in.</p>

<p>I was lying in bed watching Friday the 13th when she showed up.</p>

<p>â€œThe fetal position? Seriously?â€ she said when she saw me lying on my side with my knees drawn up. Her car didnâ€™t have air conditioning and her face was all red, the neck of her tank top dark with sweat. She had a black and white composition book tucked under one arm. When I didnâ€™t answer her, she closed the door behind her so hard she sent one of my stuffed penguins tumbling off a shelf.</p>

<p>â€œCâ€™mon,â€ she said as the penguin disappeared into a heap of dirty laundry, â€œWhatâ€™re you even going to miss about Dustin Tran?â€</p>

<p>I muted the television and tossed the remote aside. â€œGotta admit heâ€™s pretty.â€</p>

<p>â€œPretty dumb,â€ she countered, picking her way across the cluttered floor to my bed.</p>

<p>I had to give her that.</p>

<p>â€œAnd you hated that he smokes,â€ she reminded me, shoving my feet out of her way so she could sit down.</p>

<p>â€œI know.â€</p>

<p>â€œYouâ€™re better off.â€</p>

<p>â€œYouâ€™re probably right,â€ I admitted. Lia was usually right about things.</p>

<p>â€œCourse I am. You need a boyfriend, Vee. A real one. Dustin likes to mess around, but heâ€™s not exactly a relationship type of guy, you know?â€</p>

<p>â€œBelieve me, I know.â€ I rolled onto my back and stared up at the Nightmare on Elm Street 3 poster tacked to my ceiling. It was a blown up copy of one of my favorite promotional stills from the movie. In it, Freddy Krueger stood behind Nancy Thompson with his claw practically at her throat. He was wearing a tuxedo and she was in a dark blue evening gown, looking up at him with her teeth bared in a terrified grimace. It was like some sort of prom picture from hell.</p>

<p>â€œSo, what?â€ Lia asked me. â€œYou just gonna lie here all day, sucking your thumb, you big baby?â€</p>

<p>I stuck my thumb in my mouth. â€œYeth.â€</p>

<p>â€œGet up.â€ She grabbed my hand away from my face. â€œWeâ€™ve got stuff to do.â€ I tried to wipe my wet thumb on her arm, but she just knocked my hand away without even flinching. â€œWe need to find a fill-in guitarist,â€ she reminded me. â€œWe canâ€™t let Sierraâ€™s stint in rehab camp sideline us. The show must go on and all that.â€</p>

<p>â€œCan we get a new bassist while weâ€™re at it?â€ I asked, â€œI donâ€™t think I can be in a band with a boyfriend stealer. It creates a hostile work environment.â€</p>

<p>â€œDidnâ€™t we just settle this? Dustin wasnâ€™t your boyfriend. He was just the latest example of your very poor judgment and crappy taste in men.â€</p>

<p>I frowned at her. â€œAnyone ever tell you you suck at cheering people up?â€</p>

<p>â€œLook, I hate Paige, too,â€ she said, â€œbut weâ€™re kind of on a time crunch here. So Iâ€™m gonna need you to, you know, suck it up. Get with the program. Roy needs us. And I need you to help me help him.â€</p>

<p>â€œOkay, but I donâ€™t know just who you think weâ€™re going to get to play with us,â€ I said. â€œEvery decent, non-psycho musician we know is already in another band. Or have you forgotten how we ended up with Paige in the first place?â€</p>

<p>Lia opened her composition book and held it up to show me a list of names sheâ€™d scribbled in it. â€œWhat about Lana Philbin?â€ she asked, pointing at the page.</p>

<p>I gave her a thumb down.</p>

<p>â€œTessa Rodriguez?â€</p>

<p>â€œUgh.â€</p>

<p>â€œNalin Khapur?â€</p>

<p>â€œWhat is this? Your inventory of the crappiest musicians in Carreen?â€</p>

<p>Lia snapped her notebook shut. â€œWell, excuuuse me. I didnâ€™t realize your two weeks of playing drums had transformed you into some kind of musical expertâ€¦â€</p>

<p>â€œCan we please do this later?â€ I groaned. â€œIâ€™ve gotâ€¦ plans for today.â€</p>

<p>Lia glanced at the muted television screen, where Kevin Bacon was getting it in the neck with a harpoon. She made a face. â€œPlans? To do what? Lie here and sulk, watching all the Amityville movies back to back?â€</p>

<p>â€œThis is Friday the 13th,â€ I informed her, â€œand Iâ€™d like to be left alone to watch it in peace if you donâ€™t mind.â€</p>

<p>She shuddered as fake blood spurted out of Kevinâ€™s ruptured esophagus. â€œYouâ€™ve sure got a messed up way of comforting yourself,â€ she said. â€œWhy donâ€™t you watch Pretty in Pink? Suck down a vat of ice cream? Like a normal person. Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™d do. Not that Iâ€™d bother being upset in the first place. Not over Dustin Tran. Because you couldnâ€™t have paid me a million dollars to touch his nasty self to begin withâ€¦â€</p>

<p>I pulled a pillow over my face. â€œGo away!â€</p>

<p>She ripped the pillow from my hands and tossed it aside. â€œYou canâ€™t brood forever, Vee. Itâ€™s unhealthy and I forbid it.â€</p>

<p>â€œForever?â€ I said. â€œItâ€™s been twenty-four hours!â€</p>

<p>â€œWell, canâ€™t you at least come over to my house and mope there for a while, instead?â€</p>

<p>Something about the way she asked made me suspicious. â€œWhy?â€ I asked, propping myself up on my elbows. â€œWhatâ€™s going on over there?â€</p>

<p>â€œDrama,â€ she sighed. â€œMy idiot brother showed up out of nowhere last night, raving like a madman. Now everyoneâ€™s up in arms.â€</p>

<p>I paused, staring at her in surprise. â€œJake? Whatâ€™s he doing here?â€ Other than briefly at Christmas breaks, I hadnâ€™t seen Liaâ€™s brother in almost two years. Hardly an â€œidiot,â€ heâ€™d graduated early and left for college the year Lia and I were sophomores. He was pre-med at UT Austin, about to start his junior year. I couldnâ€™t imagine why heâ€™d suddenly come back to town.</p>

<p>She shrugged like she couldnâ€™t care less. â€œHeâ€™s decided to â€˜take some time offâ€™ from schoolâ€¦or something. I wasnâ€™t really paying attentionâ€¦â€ She gazed around the room. â€œHonestly, Vee, I donâ€™t know how you can sleep in here. Itâ€™s a nightmare. And I donâ€™t just mean because of all your scary-ass posters.â€ She hopped up, scratching both arms like my bed had given her cooties. â€œJust being in here for five minutes makes me itch.â€</p>

<p>I ignored her attempt to change the subject. â€œTime off?â€ I repeated, sitting up. â€œYou mean heâ€™s dropping out?â€</p>

<p>Lia exhaled. â€œI donâ€™t know details. All I know is my parents were pretty pissed this morning. Something about â€˜flushing away a full scholarship.â€™â€ She made air quotes with her fingers. â€œOr maybe they said it was his future he was pissing away? I dunno. Something, somewhere was definitely going down a toilet, though. And Iâ€™ve never heard Jake yell and cry so much in my life. Youâ€™d think he was having some kind of nervous breakdown.â€</p>

<p>I stared at her, eyes wide. That didnâ€™t sound like Jake at all. Sure, he could get pretty worked up when he was arguing with Lia, but the rest of the time he was always so calm. So cool.</p>

<p>â€œThat sounds serious, Lia. Didnâ€™t you at least ask him whatâ€™s going on?â€</p>

<p>â€œPffft,â€ she said, â€œWhy would I exchange two words with that jerk if I didnâ€™t have to?â€</p>

<p>â€œCome on,â€ I said. â€œHeâ€™s not so bad.â€</p>

<p>She gave me a skeptical look.</p>

<p>â€œWell, heâ€™s nice to me,â€ I said, patting the bed clothes in search of the remote.</p>

<p>â€œSo Iâ€™ve noticed. He behaves around you. Which is why you have to come over. Run interference before he lands me in prison for strangling him to death.â€</p>

<p>I stopped the movie and switched off the television. â€œSo you think heâ€™s back for a while?â€ I swung my legs over the side of the bed, kicking aside books and papers and other detritus in an effort to find my shoes.</p>

<p>â€œWith my luck? Probably for good,â€ she said miserably. â€œWhy?â€</p>

<p>I slipped my striped-socked feet into a beat up pair of Cons Iâ€™d uncovered. â€œI was just thinking,â€ I said as I tightened my laces. â€œMaybe we could convince him to play with us?â€ Even as I said it I knew Liaâ€™d never go for it. Which was too bad because before heâ€™d moved away, Jake had played guitar in one of my all-time favorite local bands, Burro Bruto. I knew he could really shred.</p>

<p>Sure enough, Liaâ€™s lip curled in distaste. â€œAs if. Itâ€™s bad enough I have to live with him again. No way am I letting him infiltrate my band, too.â€</p>

<h4 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h4>

<p>Lia lived in a nicer part of town than I did, although not as nice as her family couldâ€™ve afforded. Thatâ€™s because John and Elyse Mlinarich had first moved into their house when Jake was only two years old and Lia had just been born. Back then, John still worked for someone else, managing one of the less popular grocery stores in town. By the time heâ€™d bought the store, changed the name to Paper or Plastic, and expanded it into a prosperous chain a few years later, the Mlinarichs were too settled in their neighborhood to want to leave. So despite the money they now had, they still lived in a modest, three bedroom house with a small yard and a two car garage.</p>

<p>â€œAre your parents home?â€ I shouted at Lia as she turned onto her street.</p>

<p>â€œWhat?!â€ she shouted back.</p>

<p>We were riding in the green, 1977 Dodge Dart sheâ€™d gotten for her sixteenth birthday last year. The windows were rolled down and between the wind whipping past our faces and the Blank Fiction song screaming full blast out of Liaâ€™s tape deck, it was no wonder she couldnâ€™t hear me.</p>

<p>I turned the volume down on her stereo and tried again. â€œI said, are your parents home?â€ I sort of hoped they were. I loved Liaâ€™s parents. They were cute and funny and didnâ€™t act at all like theyâ€™d been married for almost twenty years. They reminded me more of some of the couples from school, always hugging and kissing and teasing one another.</p>

<p>â€œTheyâ€™d better not be,â€ she said. â€œI told them they have to park in the driveway from now on because we need the garage to rehearse. And I donâ€™t see any cars out there.â€</p>

<p>She was right; the driveway was empty when we pulled up. Jakeâ€™s blue van, however, sat against the curb, the roughly 400 miles from Austin showing all over its bug-splattered windshield and dirty tires.</p>

<p>As soon as we stepped into the house, Liaâ€™s black cat, Clyde 2, came shooting down the hallway straight toward us. The bell on his studded leather collar jingled as he tried to dash past Liaâ€™s legs and out the open front door.</p>

<p>â€œWhere do you think youâ€™re going?â€ she asked, scooping him up as I let the door slam shut behind me. â€œHuh? Huh? Did that mean old Jake scare you? Is that who youâ€™re on the run from?â€</p>

<p>The cat yowled miserably in response, collar jingling again as his furry legs cycled in vain.</p>

<p>â€œWell letâ€™s just go see about that.â€ Lia tucked the cat under her arm like a football and led me down the hall to whatâ€™d been her brotherâ€™s bedroom before heâ€™d moved away.</p>

<p>The door was closed partway but Lia pushed it open. â€œJesus, will you look at all this crap?â€ she said. I followed her in and saw what she was talking about:the flowered comforter and sheets had been ripped from the brass bed against the wall. The matching curtains had been pulled down, too, and sunlight streamed in the windows, illuminating an overwhelming mess. Boxes stood piled just about everywhere. A few cartons lay on their sides amid stacks of CDs, vinyl records, VHS tapes and a tangled heap of ratty old band t-shirts. A television and VCR with the cord wrapped around it sat on the dresser and two beat up guitar cases lay out on the bed.</p>

<p>â€œItâ€™s almost as bad as your room,â€ Lia clucked at me.</p>

<p>â€œGet outta there!â€ I heard Jake bellow from the hall.</p>

<p>Lia and I both turned as he came storming into the room. â€œNow,â€ he said.</p>

<p>He was thinner than the last time Iâ€™d seen him. His rust-colored hair looked dirty and he hadnâ€™t shaved in a while. He wore a wrinkled Alice in Chains t-shirt with a hole in it and jeans that looked as though they hadnâ€™t seen the inside of a washing machine in weeks.</p>

<p>â€œGood God, you look awful,â€ Lia told him.</p>

<p>â€œGet out,â€ he said, pointing at the door.</p>

<p>â€œIs that any way to treat a guest?â€ Lia asked him, nodding toward me. â€œYouâ€™re being rude.â€</p>

<p>Jake turned to me. Our eyes met and his expression softened. â€œHey Nic,â€ he said, lowering his arm.</p>

<p>Nic. He was the only person whoâ€™d ever called me that. I introduced and thought of myself as Veronica. Aside from Liaâ€™s use of â€œVee,â€ when people tried a nickname out on me, they usually went with â€œRonnie,â€ which I didnâ€™t care for.</p>

<p>â€œHi,â€ I said, lifting my hand.</p>

<p>He looked at my chest. â€œNice shirt.â€</p>

<p>â€œOh,â€ I glanced down at my Night of the Living Dead t-shirt. â€œThanks.â€</p>

<p>Jake lifted his eyes back up to mine. His were the same color as Liaâ€™s, light grey. But they looked tired and bloodshot, the skin beneath them shadowy. Lia was right. He looked pretty awful. Although the facial hair suited him. It accentuated his high cheekbones and strong jaw, and took attention away from the fact that his nose was a bit too big for his face. I had the strangest urge to touch all that stubble, to find out if it was as soft as it looked.</p>

<p>â€œUm,â€ I said, lowering my eyes, â€œsorry if we invaded your spaceâ€¦â€</p>

<p>â€œYou can stay if you want,â€ he told me. Then he turned to Lia, â€œBut you have to go. And take that monster with you.â€ He jabbed his finger at Clyde 2.</p>

<p>The catâ€™s ears flattened against his head. His lip curled, revealing his fangs.</p>

<p>â€œMonster?â€ said Lia, stroking the catâ€™s head as he started to growl. â€œAs if. Whatâ€™s Clyde 2 ever done to you?â€</p>

<p>â€œHeâ€™s been getting underfoot all day.â€</p>

<p>â€œWhile you did what that was so important?â€ Lia wondered.</p>

<p>â€œUnpacked,â€ he said. â€œWhatâ€™s it look like?â€</p>

<p>â€œIt looks like an unholy mess,â€ Lia told him. Just then Clyde 2 wriggled out of her grasp and tore across the room. His paws slipped on the wooden floorboards and he crashed sideways into a stack of CDs.</p>

<p>â€œFreaking cat!â€ Jake yelled as Clyde 2 regained his footing. The cat raced out the door, leaving an avalanche of spilled CDs in his wake.</p>

<p>Lia threw her head back, giggling.</p>

<p>â€œYeah, real funny,â€ Jake said. â€œNow how many times do I have to tell you? Get the hell out of my room!â€</p>

<p>â€œMake me,â€ Lia dared him.</p>

<p>He took a menacing step toward her, his hand clenched into a fist by his side. She hopped up on his bed and started bouncing up and down.</p>

<p>â€œFor Godâ€™s sake, Lia, stop being such a pain in my ass! Get down!â€ He tried to grab her arm. She whisked it out of the way, bouncing higher and out of his reach.</p>

<p>â€œMake me,â€ she repeated.</p>

<p>He swiped at her again and missed.</p>

<p>â€œHa!â€ she said and bounced away, over the opposite side of the bed.</p>

<p>He lunged after her but his shoe got tangled in the mass of sheets piled beside the bed. He lost his balance and flopped across the mattress.</p>

<p>â€œSmooth move, Ex-Lax,â€ Lia taunted him, skipping exaggeratedly across the room. â€œHave a nice trip! See you next fall!â€</p>

<p>Before Jake could recover, sheâ€™d pulled back the flaps of one of his cardboard boxes and started rifling through the contents. She held up a raggedy teddy bear sheâ€™d found, waving its paw at me. â€œAw, look, Vee, Mr. Buttons went away to college, too!â€</p>

<p>Jake sprang up from the bed to pluck the bear out of her hands. He shoved her roughly away from the stack of boxes. â€œThis is not the stuff I brought back with me,â€ he assured me.</p>

<p>I pressed my lips together, trying not to laugh. I knew Lia was only trying to embarrass him. After Jake had moved out, his mom had redecorated his bedroom, intending to convert it into a guest room. Sheâ€™d wound up just using it as a storage space, dumping the familyâ€™s old junk into it little by little. The hideous floral linen set and easily two thirds of the boxes were hers.</p>

<p>â€œI know that,â€ I said.</p>

<p>He scratched his head. â€œAnyway, sorry about the messâ€¦â€</p>

<p>â€œDonâ€™t feel bad, my roomâ€™s worse,â€ I admitted.</p>

<p>He almost smiled, one corner of his mouth lifting higher than the other. He stuffed Mr. Buttons back into his box, closed it up and rested his elbow on top of it, trying to look casual. â€œSo, uh, Lia tells me thatâ€™s your drum kit out in the garage,â€ he said. â€œWhat happened? Thought you swore youâ€™d never play?â€</p>

<p>Lia and Jake had always made music. They hopped continually from one band to another, sometimes playing with more than one at a time. Despite Liaâ€™s repeated offers to teach me to play somethingâ€”and assurances itâ€™d be â€œso funâ€ if we were in a band togetherâ€”Iâ€™d remained content to sit on the sidelines and write about shows for her zine. I didnâ€™t exactly love the idea of being out on stage, the center of attention. Iâ€™d only agreed to play now because Liaâ€™d begged me to, and because I wouldâ€™ve felt bad if I hadnâ€™t at least tried to help Roy save his restaurant.</p>

<p>â€œItâ€™s Sierraâ€™s kit,â€ I demurred. â€œOur guitarist? She plays pretty much every instrument. Anyway, Iâ€™m just borrowing it because Lia talked me into joining her band to help Roy. Weâ€™re playing this benefit Lia put together to try and raise money for himâ€¦â€</p>

<p>â€œYou know Lynchâ€™s is about to cave?â€ Lia interrupted me to ask her brother. â€œRoyâ€™s way behind on the rent.â€</p>

<p>Jake nodded. â€œI heard. So, you any good?â€ he asked me.</p>

<p>â€œNo,â€ I said.</p>

<p>Lia sat down, cross-legged, on Jakeâ€™s bed. â€œSheâ€™s getting there, though.â€</p>

<p>â€œI am not,â€ I assured him.</p>

<p>â€œWell are you guys playing any time before this benefit thing?â€ he asked. â€œSomeplace I can come check you out?â€</p>

<p>Iâ€™d always liked the way Jake talked. His voice was deep, his slow Texan drawl making it seem like whatever he said was important enough to wait to hear. I wished I could talk like that. My voice was thin and nervous-sounding, every word coming out in a rush.</p>

<p>â€œUm, probably not,â€ I told him. â€œOur guitarist just got sent away to some sort of juvie camp. Weâ€™ll be lucky to find someone to replace her and be halfway ready to play by the benefit, much less before then.â€</p>

<p>â€œChill out, Vee,â€ Lia said. â€œItâ€™s rock nâ€™ roll. Doesnâ€™t have to be perfect.â€</p>

<p>Jake crossed his arms. â€œAnything I can do to help you guys out?â€</p>

<p>I stared at him, hardly able to believe it: heâ€™d just given me the perfect opening to ask him to join our band!</p>

<p>â€œWell, actuallyâ€¦â€ I began. Lia shook her head furiously at me. She pulled her finger across her throat, but I ignored her. â€œWe were thinking of asking you if youâ€™d be interested in taking Sierraâ€™s place. If youâ€™d, you know, play guitar with us.â€</p>

<p>â€œOh, yeah?â€ he asked.</p>

<p>Lia dropped her face into her hand.</p>

<p>â€œYeah. I mean, if youâ€™re going to stick around for a while.â€</p>

<p>He looked me in the eyes for a second. â€œIâ€™ll be home for a while. I can do it.â€</p>

<p>â€œReally?â€ I said. I hadnâ€™t expected him to just say yes like that.</p>

<p>Jake shrugged. â€œRoyâ€™s a good guy. Iâ€™ve always liked him. And itâ€™d be a shame if Lynchâ€™s folded.â€</p>

<p>â€œOh, gosh,â€ I said. â€œThatâ€™s so great! I mean, thank youâ€¦â€</p>

<p>â€œOkay, time out,â€ Lia interrupted me again, holding her hands up in the shape of a â€˜T.â€™</p>

<p>â€œWhatâ€™s the matter?â€ I asked her.</p>

<p>â€œIâ€™m already working on getting someone lined up for the gig. We talked about it earlier. Remember?â€ She gave me a hard look.</p>

<p>â€œI remember you saying you werenâ€™t sure who we were going to get yetâ€¦â€</p>

<p>She jumped up and stalked straight toward me. â€œYeah, well, Iâ€™m sure Jakeâ€™s got a lot of other things to do besides hang around with us. Like look for a job before Dad kicks his lazy ass out of the house.â€ She grabbed my arm and started pulling me toward the door.</p>

<p>â€œIt doesnâ€™t matter to me one way or another if you donâ€™t want my help,â€ said Jake. â€œJust figured Iâ€™d offer.â€</p>

<p>â€œWell, thanks,â€ Lia told him over her shoulder, â€œbut no thanks. Letâ€™s go, Vee.â€</p>

<p>â€œButâ€¦â€</p>

<p>â€œLetâ€™s go.â€ She pushed me out into the hall. â€œWeâ€™ve got a lot of stuff to do.â€ I looked back through the open door at Jake. He held two fingers to his forehead and then brought them back down in mock salute. I wanted to stay behind and ask him what he was doing back, if it was true heâ€™d dropped out of school and if so, why. But Lia dragged me down the hall to her bedroom.</p>
