<h4 id="chapter-one">Chapter One</h4>

<p><strong>Lady Melody Thornhaven had</strong> only moments left to live.</p>

<p>She dangled helplessly over the precipice, the rope knotted cruelly about her wrists beginning to fray. Already she had watched both slippers slide off her dainty feet and plummet into the gaping chasm below; soon the rest of her would follow suit, never to be seen or heard from again. Her only hope now was for Josef, the sagacious and gold-hearted blacksmith from the nearby village, to miraculously happen by and rescue her. Rourke was certain he would. In fact, she had a feeling Josef would not only save Melody, but that he would whisk her away with him back to the charming little cottage behind his smithy, and loyally protect her while she convalesced.</p>

<p>Until now, Melody had always ignored Josef, but while secreted away with him, she would have no choice but to finally pay attention to him, to at last realize the overwhelming depths of his intelligence, sensitivity, and kindness. She would swiftly recognize that although he was a dirt-poor peasant, he was still far better for her than that awful earl who, although wealthy and handsome, had only wanted to marry her so that he could plunder her land and then, when sheâ€™d found him out, had hired thugs to string her up over the gorge. After a day or so in the blacksmithâ€™s enchanting company, Melody, fully infatuated, and still suffused with gratitude over her rescue, would cease to care that Josef wasnâ€™t nobility â€“ or that his appealingly rugged features had been slightly disfigured all those years ago in a smelting accident. Her father would likely threaten to renounce her for wanting to marry beneath her, but Melody wouldnâ€™t care about that, either. She would know true love was more important than riches â€“ more important than anything â€“ and she would readily sacrifice her pampered existence at her familyâ€™s manor estate in exchange for a simple but happy life in the blacksmithâ€™s cottage as his wife, and as the mother to his many, many childrenâ€¦</p>

<p>At least that was what Rourke assumed would happen. What she hoped would happen. Biting her thumbnail, she swiped the page to find out, butâ€¦the words morphed into a hopeless blur as her phone was rudely yanked away.</p>

<p>â€œHey!â€ she cried.</p>

<p>â€œAre you listening?â€ Julia demanded. â€œI said weâ€™re almost there.â€</p>

<p>â€œNo, I wasnâ€™t listening,â€ Rourke snapped, snatching back her phone, â€œI was reading.â€</p>

<p>Julia cast a reproving glance at her younger sister, watching as she fumbled to relocate her place in her e-book. â€œYou know, if Mom were here, she wouldnâ€™t let you read that romance garbage,â€ she said. â€œItâ€™s not exactly for kids.â€</p>

<p>Rourke scowled. She knew her sister thought she only read romance novels for the titillation, but that wasnâ€™t true. She read them for the love. For the encouragement they offered, and hope they represented, in a world where it often seemed most people cared only about themselves â€“ and where far too many people seemed destined to wind up bitter and alone.</p>

<p>But there was no sense in getting into all that with her sister right now. Juliaâ€™s pinched expression told Rourke her patience, as usual, was wearing thin.</p>

<p>â€œYeah, well, Iâ€™m not exactly a kid,â€ Rourke muttered. â€œAnd get real. If Mom were here, sheâ€™d probably be so wasted she wouldnâ€™t know what day of the week it was, much less what I was reading.â€</p>

<p>Her sister opened her mouth to protest, but then shut it again. She knew what Rourke had just said was true. Their mother, Linda, was a â€œlush.â€ That was what their Great-aunt Jeanie had called her, anyway. Rourke had looked up the unfamiliar term and discovered it was an old-fashioned word for â€œdrunk.â€ Which was certainly apt. Although to Lindaâ€™s credit, she was at least trying to get better. She was currently in rehab drying out, which was why Julia was here, driving Rourke to her first day at her new school instead of their mom.</p>

<p>With her mother locked away, someone needed to watch over Rourke until she graduated from high school and turned eighteen in a few months, and after Great-Aunt Jeanie, the geographically closest relative, had bailed, Julia was next on the list of feasible wardens. Rourkeâ€™s half-sister was twenty-five years old, relatively stable and responsible. She lived on her own and worked as an ER nurse in Fort Worth. Or at least she had until sheâ€™d quit her job there and gotten a new one here, in Carreen, Texas. The move had been prompted by their maternal grandmother, Samantha, who, according to Julia, had offered them the use of her house on Carreenâ€™s Garden Street so that Rourke could attend â€œa decent school districtâ€ and the two sisters wouldnâ€™t have to live â€œright on top of one anotherâ€ in Juliaâ€™s studio apartment in the city. Someday, when Samantha passed, the house would belong to Rourke and Julia anyway, but at the moment Grandma Sam was still alive and kicking â€“ and as of three months ago, kicking it in a beach house down in Galveston with her French bulldog, Buford, while the Carreen house stood empty and unused. Julia, who liked the city, her job, her <em>life</em>, just the way it was had initially rejected the offer, but Samantha hadnâ€™t given up. She had called Julia and harangued her, asking why sheâ€™d insist on continuing to pay exorbitant rent for a â€œcramped little coffinâ€ in some squalid downtown enclave when she could live for free in a roomy, two-story house with a huge backyard, in a suitable neighborhood instead? Julia had reportedly responded that she liked her â€œcoffinâ€ just fine, thank-you-very-much, to which Samantha had retorted she would never understand Juliaâ€™s generation, or how ungrateful they could sometimes be.</p>

<p>Fun times.</p>

<p>Eventually, however, Samantha had gotten Rourkeâ€™s sister to see reason. Rourke wasnâ€™t clear on all the details of the negotiation, nor did she particularly care about them. The important thing was Julia had come to her senses and, two weeks later, the Featherstone sisters had found themselves back in Carreen, unpacking boxes at the house on Garden Street. Rourke was ecstatic. It was exactly the outcome sheâ€™d been praying for. Her hometown was no bustling metropolis â€“ it was a lot smaller, a lot less exciting, and a bit quainter and more Mayberry-ish than most of the other places sheâ€™d lived â€“ but Rourke wasnâ€™t the type of person who needed much excitement, anyway. So long as a town had a working public library, she was content. And besides, she had another, more personal reason for believing Carreen was the best possible place in the entire universe to live.</p>

<p>Rourke looked out the passengerâ€™s side window, hunting for that Personal Reason now, but he was as yet nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>â€œAre you sure you donâ€™t want me to come in with you?â€ Julia asked. Her expression had gone from merely pinched to downright beleaguered, her manicured hands throttling the steering wheel as she pulled the car to the curb. â€œJust to make sure you find your first class without any problems-?â€</p>

<p>Rourkeâ€™s shoulders tensed with anxiety. â€œ<em>No</em>,â€ she said quickly.</p>

<p>Her sister shot her a dubious glance.</p>

<p>â€œI mean, uh, no, thanks, that, wonâ€™t be necessary,â€ Rourke said.</p>

<p>â€œAre you <em>sure</em>?â€</p>

<p>â€œPositive.â€ Rourke shook her head emphatically. â€œIâ€™ll be fine. You hooked me up with my very own tour guide, remember?â€</p>

<p>Julia seemed to relax, bringing one hand up to smooth the neckline of her scrubs. â€œThe counselor called it a â€˜peer aide,â€™â€ she corrected with a sniff, â€œand I figured if the school offers help to students with a need, why not take advantage of it?â€</p>

<p>Rourkeâ€™s mouth twitched to one side. â€œBy â€˜students with a need,â€™ I think they mean, you know, <em>students with a need</em>.â€</p>

<p>Julia gave her a blank look.</p>

<p>â€œAs in itâ€™s a program for people with issues,â€ Rourke clarified.</p>

<p>Juliaâ€™s mouth curled at one corner. â€œYou have issues.â€</p>

<p>Rourke narrowed her eyes. â€œNot that kind. Besides, I just donâ€™t see the point. Dalâ€™s here. You know I can count on him if I need anything.â€</p>

<p>Juliaâ€™s smirk collapsed. She pursed her lips and peered through the windshield, darting a cool gaze around the lawn of Carreen High. â€œHeâ€™s here? Where? I donâ€™t see him, do you?â€</p>

<p>Rourke toyed with her hoodieâ€™s drawstrings and looked out her window again. Despite the early hour, the lawn was swarming with students, but not the tall, dark, and handsome one she was veritably aching to see. â€œNot yet,â€ she admitted, trying to hide her disappointment. â€œBut Iâ€™m sure heâ€™ll find me. He promised.â€</p>

<p>Juliaâ€™s chuckle was humorless. â€œYeah, well, I think we both know better than to put too much stock into the promise of one of those Mackenzie men, now donâ€™t we?â€ she sneered.</p>

<p>Rourke bristled at the snide comment, but fought the urge to answer back. Julia had some odd â€“ and completely wrong-headed â€“ ideas about Dallas and his father, David, but Rourke doubted anything she said right now would change her sisterâ€™s mind about either man.</p>

<p>Turning away, she pulled down the visor and checked her face in the mirror. Her make-up looked okay, but because Julia had made her get here so darn early, she hadnâ€™t had time to do much about her hair. It was just lying there, limp as a dishrag. But she supposed it didnâ€™t matter. Dallas had seen her looking worse sometimes, particularly when sheâ€™d been sick, although that had always been through a computer or a cell phone screen. Sheâ€™d hoped to look her best once she finally saw him again in person. With a resigned sigh she said, â€œJust let me out here, okay? Iâ€™ll find him.â€</p>

<p>Julia didnâ€™t budge.</p>

<p>â€œIâ€™ll be <em>fine</em>,â€ Rourke insisted.</p>

<p>Her sister sighed, too, blowing her bangs out of her eyes, but she unlocked the car doors. â€œSo where should I pick you up this afternoon? Here?â€</p>

<p>Rourke unbuckled her seatbelt. â€œYou donâ€™t need to pick me up. Dal said heâ€™ll give me a ride home.â€</p>

<p>Juliaâ€™s eyebrows arched. â€œWhen did he say that? I thought you said he was out of town all weekend at his grandparentsâ€™.â€</p>

<p>Rourke held up her phone, giving her sister an incredulous look.</p>

<p>Julia smiled stiffly. â€œOh. Right. He texted you.â€ Then, under her breath, â€œProbably about fifty times.â€</p>

<p><em>Try more like a hundred</em>, Rourke thought, and pushed open the door, <em>but thatâ€™s only because he was so busy</em>. She hopped out onto the sidewalk.</p>

<p>â€œWait!â€ Juliaâ€™s shout came just as the door slammed.</p>

<p>Rourke stopped, clenching her jaw. She heard the car window slide down behind her and turned to see her sister leaning over the seat. â€œIf he flakes out on you, give me a call,â€ Julia said. â€œIâ€™ll find someone to cover for me at the hospital and Iâ€™ll be here in a flash. Actually, if you need <em>anything</em> at all today, just call meâ€¦â€</p>

<p>â€œâ€˜Bye, Jules!â€ Rourke waved away the insulting comments, turned and jogged toward the lawn, already switching her attention back to her phone. As she heard Julia finally drive away behind her, she tapped out a quick text: <em>Dal, Iâ€™m here. Where r u?</em></p>

<p>The reply was almost instantaneous:  <em>Finally! And whereâ€™s â€˜here,â€™ exactly? I donâ€™t see u.</em></p>

<p>Rourke looked around. <em>Iâ€™m on the, umâ€¦right side of the school?</em></p>

<p>As she hit â€˜send,â€™ someone bumped into her, hard. The phone leapt out of her hand and clattered to the sidewalk. Before she could rescue it, some guy wearing combat boots passed by and unknowingly kicked it out of her reach, directly into the path of an oncoming crowd. â€œDarn it!â€ Rourke muttered.</p>

<p>Behind her, she heard someone else curse and then a different boy was darting out in front of her, risking the mob to snatch Rourkeâ€™s phone from out of harmâ€™s way. He trotted back with it in his hand. â€œHey, are you alright?â€ he asked. â€œI knocked into you pretty hard.â€</p>

<p>Heâ€™d have touched Rourkeâ€™s shoulder, but she twitched out of his reach. â€œCan I please have my phone back?â€ she said.</p>

<p>He held it out. â€œSorry, it was totally my fault. Hope your phoneâ€™s okay.â€</p>

<p>Rourke scowled as she snatched the phone out of the strangerâ€™s hand and looked it over. Her chest burned with irritation, and a barbed response leapt to her tongue. But then her psychologist, Dr. Borisâ€™s, voice filtered through her thoughts, urging her to stay calm. <em>Itâ€™s your choice whether or not to get angry</em>, Dr. Boris always said. But it didnâ€™t usually feel like a choice to Rourke. â€œYeah, it seems alright,â€ she finally muttered.</p>

<p>â€œSorry,â€ the stranger said again. Then, after a pause, â€œHey, are you new here? I donâ€™t think I know you.â€</p>

<p>She finally looked up at him.</p>

<p>And gulped.</p>

<p>Because he was adorable, with light brown hair that brushed his shoulders, aqua eyes, and a chiseled jaw. The corners of his mouth were curved up in a gently teasing smile. Rourke couldnâ€™t believe it, but he looked almost exactly like her mental picture of Josef the blacksmith. Without the smelting scars, of course.</p>

<p>â€œUh,â€ she said, her grip on her phone tightening. â€œYeah. Yes. I mean,â€ she blinked. â€œYes, Iâ€™m new. Today.â€</p>

<p>The guyâ€™s smile widened and she had the horrifying impression he was about to start laughing at her. Well, no wonder. She was making a fool of herself. But he didnâ€™t laugh. He just pushed his hand through his hair and said, â€œCool. Whatâ€™s your name? Iâ€™m Casey, by the way.â€</p>

<p>He held his other hand out to her. When she took it she found that Caseyâ€™s fingers were cool and he had a firm handshake. <em>Very</em> firm.</p>

<p>â€œIâ€™mâ€¦â€ she said, and trailed off. Because his lively eyes were mesmerizing, mirroring the light turquoise color of his long-sleeve Henley. With effort, she broke eye contact, dipping her gaze down to get a peek at some of the rest of him. He had long legs, she noticed. A broad chest. His sleeves were pushed up, baring sculpted forearms, and the buttons at his collar were undone, exposing the hollow of his throat and a length of thin black cord that stood out darkly against his tan skinâ€¦</p>

<p>â€œYeah?â€ he said, sounding amused.</p>

<p>â€œHm?â€ She looked at his face again, realizing he had the most adorable pair of dimples.</p>

<p>â€œYouâ€™reâ€¦â€ he prompted, lifting his eyebrows.</p>

<p>â€œIâ€™mâ€¦â€ she said. <em>Sheesh, Rourke, spit it out</em>. â€œRourke,â€ she managed. â€œIâ€™m Rourke. Featherstone. Nice to meet you.â€</p>

<p>Caseyâ€™s eyebrows lifted even higher. â€œRourke?â€ he repeated. â€œThatâ€™s an unusual name.â€ His eyes lit up. â€œSay, youâ€™re not named after Mickey Rourke, are you? The actor?â€</p>

<p>Rourkeâ€™s heart plummeted with disappointment. She snatched back her hand, plunging it deep into the pocket of her hoodie. â€œNo, Iâ€™m not,â€ she snapped, and shot him an automatic frown. Because if she had a dollar for every time someone asked her that silly question, sheâ€™dâ€¦well, sheâ€™d have a lot of money. More than enough money to download every e-book in the <em>Ladies and Peasants</em> historical romance series at full price. But still not enough to compensate for how annoying it was to have to answer that same stupid question over and over again her entire life.</p>

<p>â€œOh,â€ Caseyâ€™s head jerked back. â€œWellâ€¦It was nice meeting you, anyway. I guess.â€ He slid one foot behind him, backing away. â€œUm, have a good first dayâ€¦â€</p>

<p>Guilt washed over Rourke as she saw how abashed he looked. With effort, she relaxed the muscles in her face, trying to look less angry. After all, it wasnâ€™t Caseyâ€™s fault she was so edgy on her first day at yet another new school, or that she felt a little discombobulated after being ambushed into introducing herself to the cutest guy sheâ€™d met in a long time. â€œThanks,â€ she said, and managed to force a smile.</p>

<p>Casey smiled back weakly, the expression not nearly as open and friendly as it had been before. <em>Shoot</em>, she thought, watching him turn on his heel and retreat into the school building. <em>Way to screw that up, Rourke</em>. But then she glanced at her phone and realized she didnâ€™t have much time to dwell on it. She was supposed to have been in someplace called the â€˜Student Study Centerâ€™ five minutes ago.</p>

<p>She was hurrying down a hallway when her phone buzzed.</p>

<p><em>The â€˜rightâ€™ side of the building? Do you mean North? Learn directions, lol.</em></p>

<p>She rolled her eyes at the screen. She was about to text back and suggest Dallas hush his mouth when he sent her another message:  <em>Arenâ€™t you supposed to be meeting your welcoming committee in the SSC?</em></p>

<p>She grimaced as she read the words. Silly Julia and her silly ideas! Rourke had changed schools seven times now. In the past, sheâ€™d always been considered perfectly capable of handling her own business, but apparently once your mother got divorced for the third time, sank to the bottom of a bottle and agreed to be sent away, things changed. First you had to go and live with your elderly great-aunt for a few months, just because she happened to live in the same town as you. Then, a few bad grades, a few skipped meals â€“ and, yeah, okay, one uncontrollable crying jag under the gym bleachers â€“ later, you found yourself seeing a shrink twice a month. After that it didnâ€™t take long to go from being considered â€œin troubleâ€ to â€œtoo much trouble,â€ and being shipped off to live with your high-strung older sister down in Texas instead. And apparently around here, if the administration knew about your â€œissues,â€ they assigned a babysitter to escort you around your new school so you wouldnâ€™t get too stressed out and have another meltdown.</p>

<p>Rourke sighed. At least she had managed to talk the vice principal down to only a single day of â€œpeer aideâ€ supervision, rather than the full week Julia had initially pushed for. <em>Donâ€™t remind me</em>, she texted Dallas.</p>

<p><em>U know where that is?</em></p>

<p><em>Yeah, the VP showed me when I came to enroll.</em></p>

<p><em>So just go straight there</em>, he instructed. <em>Iâ€™ll find u.</em>
<br /> 
<br />
<br /></p>

<h4 id="chapter-two">Chapter Two</h4>

<p><strong>The babysitter didnâ€™t look</strong> anything like Rourke had anticipated. She wasnâ€™t sure why, but she had expected a girl, someone prim and uptight with impeccable fashion sense and perfect posture. Instead she was met by a tall, lanky boy with messy russet-colored hair who seemed perpetually to be fidgeting. When he greeted her, Rourke saw that what sheâ€™d heard about CHS was true:  it was a different sort of school. Progressive. Even body art was allowed here. This boy, for instance, had a face full of metal â€“ two rings in his right earlobe, a barbell in his left cartilage, and another spearing his right eyebrow, not to mention the full set of braces glinting from his teeth. He said his name was Clinton Krantz but that everyone called him â€œC-Dawg.â€ She instantly liked him anyway.</p>

<p>â€œSorry if I kept you waiting,â€ he said, â€œbut I was running a little late. My mom was being a pain in my ass this morning, trying to get me to help her feed my little brothers. I was like â€˜whatever.â€™ Howâ€™s it my problem? Like Iâ€™m always telling her, if she didnâ€™t want to have to deal with babies dumping their Cheerios all over her at her advanced age, she shouldnâ€™t have gotten back together with my dad and let him knock her up again, this time with twins, amiright?â€</p>

<p>Rourke chuckled, which made Clinton smile. A slotted card reader jutted from the door to the Center. He swiped his student I.D. through it, opening the door, and ushered Rourke into a spacious room lined with bookshelves and computers.</p>

<p>â€œItâ€™s no problem,â€ she whispered to him. â€œI didnâ€™t have to wait long. I was running a little late, too.â€</p>

<p>Clinton smiled down at her. â€œCool, butâ€¦you donâ€™t have to whisper. This isnâ€™t a library. Itâ€™s just a place where people can get together and work on homework or projects or whatever. We can talk as long as itâ€™s not too loud.â€ He led her to an empty table on the far side of the room. Other students lifted their heads to stare curiously at Rourke as she passed, but when they saw she was with Clinton, their expressions softened. Most of them smiled; some even waved. Observing these reactions, Rourke felt a smidgen of invisible weight lift from her shoulders. Sheâ€™d been dreading having a shadow on her first day, but now she saw how it might work to her advantage. She could already tell Clinton was cool. People obviously liked him. Having him glued to her hip all day would undoubtedly attract unwanted attention, but it might also make it easier for Rourke to meet people. To maybe even make a few friends for a change.</p>

<p>â€œHey, Iâ€™ve got presents for you,â€ Clinton said, reaching into his tattered backpack as they sat down. â€œHappy birthday.â€</p>

<p>She thumbed through the sheaf of papers heâ€™d handed her:  a copy of the New Student Handbook, a map of the school, a temporary parking pass, and a ticket for a free lunch in the cafeteria. â€œOoh, howâ€™d you know?â€ she said, which made him laugh.</p>

<p>He took out his phone and danced his fingers across the screen. â€œListen, my usual M.O. is to go over a few things with you here in the Center first. Then we take a little tour of the school, get your I.D. made, find your locker and such. Iâ€™ve downloaded your schedule to my phone, so Iâ€™ll walk with you to each of your classes today, just to make sure you know where everything is and that your teachers are ready for you.â€ He reached over and picked up the new student handbook.</p>

<p>â€œSeriously?â€ Rourke felt more weight disappear from her shoulders. â€œThatâ€™s awesome.â€</p>

<p>Clinton was flipping through the handbook when two girls approached.</p>

<p>â€œClinton,â€ the first one said, â€œis this your latest charge? Introduce me.â€</p>

<p>Clinton looked up, making eye contact with the speaker. His lips parted but no sound came out of his mouth.</p>

<p>Rourke could see why he was suddenly tongue-tied. The girl whoâ€™d issued the command was drop-dead gorgeous, with a flawless olive complexion and sleek black hair that hung in waves over her shoulders. Behind her stylish glasses, her eyes were a deep, sparkling green and ringed by thick, dark lashes.</p>

<p>â€œClinton?â€ The girl bent forward and snapped her fingers an inch in front of his nose. â€œHello?â€</p>

<p>Clinton shook his head as if to rouse himself. Sounding dazed, he murmured, â€œSorry. Maddison Garcia, this is Rourke Featherstone. Rourke, Maddison â€“ sheâ€™s an aide, too.â€</p>

<p>â€œYou can call me Maddie,â€ the girl beamed at Rourke. â€œAnd this is Lauren.â€ She gestured at the girl peeking out shyly from behind her shoulder.</p>

<p>â€œHello,â€ the second girl offered, so quietly that Rourke almost didnâ€™t hear her. Lauren wore glasses, too, Rourke noticed, but they were unflattering, their thick lenses slightly magnifying her already owlish brown eyes. Her hair was pulled back, woven into a severe French braid, and she was pale and skinny, drowning in a voluminous t-shirt and overalls.</p>

<p>â€œHi,â€ Rourke said to the girls. â€œNice to meet you.â€</p>

<p>Maddison offered a heart-stopping smile. She pushed her hair back over her shoulder and slid into one of the empty seats. Lauren sat down beside her, producing a notebook computer from a backpack. Within moments she was absorbed in something on her screen, ignoring everyone else at the table.</p>

<p>â€œSo, youâ€™re new?â€ Maddison asked Rourke.</p>

<p>Rourke nodded.</p>

<p>â€œAre you a senior?â€</p>

<p>â€œYeah.â€</p>

<p>â€œIsnâ€™t that a little weird? I mean, it must be tough switching schools right now, with only a few months left until graduation.â€</p>

<p>Rourke squirmed in her molded plastic chair. â€œActually, I wonâ€™t be graduating until August. And thatâ€™s assuming I do okay in summer school.â€</p>

<p>Maddisonâ€™s impeccably groomed eyebrows rose. â€œSummer school?â€</p>

<p>â€œIâ€™m usually a good student,â€ Rourke said quickly, â€œbut Iâ€™ve, uh, fallen behind. Iâ€™ve had a fewâ€¦setbacks.â€ She hoped Maddison wouldnâ€™t ask her for more details.</p>

<p>She didnâ€™t. Instead the other girl pulled her phone from her purse, tapping and scrolling as she talked. â€œSo where are you from?â€ she asked.</p>

<p>Rourke glanced at Clinton, whose eyes were glued to the New Student Handbook. Beads of sweat had materialized at his temples.</p>

<p>â€œIâ€™m actually from Carreen,â€ Rourke said, â€œoriginally. I lived here until I was eight.â€</p>

<p>â€œOh, yeah? Whereâ€™ve you been since then?â€</p>

<p>Rourke shrugged. â€œAll over the place. Arkansas, New Mexico, South Carolina, most recently Pennsylvania.â€</p>

<p>Maddison looked impressed, her eyes growing even as they remained fixated on her cell phone screen. â€œWow, thatâ€™s a lot of places. So what brings you back here?â€</p>

<p><em>Darn</em>, Rourke thought, wishing sheâ€™d taken the time to craft a convincing cover story. But sheâ€™d been too preoccupied the last few days, thinking about Dallas, her mind muddled with euphoria over the thought of finally seeing him again. â€œWell, um, my momâ€¦I mean, my sisterâ€¦â€ Before she could decide how best to answer, the door to the Center squeaked open. A deep voice called into the room, â€œMerry? You in here?â€</p>

<p>Rourke stiffened in her seat. She heard the rattle and scrape of chairs as everyone else in the room turned toward the door.</p>

<p>Maddison finally looked up from her phone again. Her eyes widened. â€œOh my God,â€ she said.</p>

<p>â€œMerry?â€ the call came again, a little louder this time.</p>

<p>Rourke took a breath, bracing herself to turn around. Before she could, Maddisonâ€™s hand shot across the table and grabbed her wrist. â€œCan you please tell me why the hottest guy in school is shouting at you?â€ she demanded under her breath.</p>

<p>â€œWho?â€ Rourke said.</p>

<p>Maddisonâ€™s brows drew together. She dropped her phone to the table. â€œDallas Aaron Mackenzie,â€ she said in a choked whisper. â€œEven his initials spell <em>daaamn</em>.â€</p>

<p>Rourke laughed.</p>

<p>Maddisonâ€™s grip tightened. She looked at Rourke with round eyes. â€œIâ€™m not <em>kidding</em>,â€ she said. â€œHeâ€™s been the star of every theater production since ninth grade and Iâ€™ve been in love with him, oh, <em>roughly</em> as long. God, he played Romeo last year? Just remembering it gives me goosebumps. I could have clawed the eyes out of the little trollop playing Juliet, I was so jealous.â€ She fanned herself with her free hand. â€œGod, he makes me sweat like a whore in church.â€</p>

<p>Rourke smirked. â€œUm, okay. But what makes you think heâ€™s talking to me-?â€</p>

<p>â€œHello, heâ€™s looking right at you.â€ Maddison jabbed a finger over Rourkeâ€™s shoulder.</p>

<p>Rourke looked back. She spied a boy in snug, dark-rinse jeans and a plain black t-shirt making his way across the room to her, navigating impatiently between chairs and desks. Instantly she saw what Maddison had been talking about. The guy was easily six feet tall and handsome, with an athletic build, thick black hair, and eyes that appeared penetratingly ice-blue even from this distance.</p>

<p>Or, to put it another way:  <em>daaamn</em>.</p>

<p>Rourkeâ€™s heart leapt into her throat at the sight of him, but she decided to have a little fun. She turned back to Maddison. Hooking her thumb over her shoulder, she asked, â€œ<em>Thatâ€™s</em> the hottest guy in school?â€</p>

<p>Maddison paused. She let go of Rourkeâ€™s wrist and sat back. â€œYou donâ€™t think so?â€</p>

<p>Rourke shrugged. â€œSure. If thatâ€™s what youâ€™re into.â€</p>

<p>Maddisonâ€™s nose wrinkled in annoyance. â€œTall, gorgeous, built like no oneâ€™s businessâ€¦yeah, Iâ€™d say thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m into. And screw you if you say youâ€™re notâ€¦â€ Her gaze darted over Rourkeâ€™s shoulder again. â€œAnd oh my God, heâ€™s coming over here. And yep, heâ€™s definitely trying to get your attention. Only, why is he calling you â€˜Maryâ€™? I thought you said your name was Rourke? Does he have you confused with someone else?â€ She was the one who looked confused.</p>

<p>Rourke shook her head. â€œHeâ€™s not saying â€˜Mary,â€™ itâ€™sâ€¦â€</p>

<p>â€œMerry!â€</p>

<p>Rourke turned again. And there he was, less than a yard away from her for the first time in almost ten years. Dallas Mackenzie. Theater star. â€œHottest guy in schoolâ€ (supposedly). Also her best friend in the entire world, ever. Rourke reminded herself sheâ€™d known this guy since they were both six years old and building pillow forts together in his dadâ€™s living room. She knew him better than anyone else in the world, and vice versa. There was no good reason to be so darned nervous right now, and yetâ€¦she still felt as though her heart might be about to thump its way out of her ribcage.</p>

<p>She lifted her hand, giving Dallas a little wave. â€œHey, Dal.â€</p>

<p>â€œHey yourself,â€ he said, jogging the last few steps to the table. â€œGlad I finally found you. Sorry I missed you outside. I was waiting on the South â€“ oh, sorry, I mean <em>right</em> side of the building.â€ He pushed his hair off his forehead, flashing a winsome grin.</p>

<p>Rourke gulped. She pushed her chair back, standing up on legs that were suddenly shaky. â€œThatâ€™s okay. We should have just planned to meet here anywayâ€¦â€</p>

<p>â€œHi, Dallas!â€ Maddison blurted.</p>

<p>With a start, Dallas glanced over at her. He gave Maddison an uncertain smile. â€œUm, hi?â€ he said. It was clear from his blank expression he had no idea who the other girl was.</p>

<p>Maddison grinned, undeterred. She seemed about to say something else, but Dallas turned away from her, refocusing on Rourke. â€œGeez, Merry,â€ he said, gazing wonderingly at her, â€œitâ€™s so freaking great to finally see you again. In the flesh, I mean.â€</p>

<p>â€œYeah,â€ she said weakly, â€œyou, too.â€</p>

<p>Rourke was surprised she could speak at all. Dallasâ€™s sapphire gaze, disarming enough over her computer screen during one of their weekly webchats, was, in person, startlingly intense. She felt he was seeing straight into her soul. â€œYou, um, you look good,â€ she squeaked.</p>

<p>He gave her a lopsided smile. â€œLikewise. So how you been, little sis?â€</p>

<p>â€œSis?â€ Maddison practically screeched. â€œAs in â€“ this new girlâ€™s your <em>sister</em>?â€</p>

<p>All around her, Rourke heard people shifting in their chairs again. She could feel everyone in the roomâ€™s curiosity trained on her like laser beams, but neither she nor Dallas turned to face them, or to answer Maddison. They were too busy still staring at one another, Rourke wondering what she ought to do now. Shake Dallasâ€™s hand? Hug him? Tackle him to the carpet and smother him with kisses? Thankfully, before she could succumb to any ill-advised impulses, Dallas reached out and put his hand around her elbow. â€œHey,â€ he said to the others, â€œdo you guys mind if I talk to Merry in private for just a sec?â€ Without waiting for an answer, he tugged Rourke away from the table.</p>

<p>â€œDal?â€ she said. â€œWhatâ€™s going on? Is everything alright?â€</p>

<p>He maneuvered her between two bookcases. â€œIt really is good to see you,â€ he said, stopping and turning her to face him. â€œAmazing, in fact.â€</p>

<p>Then he was slipping his arm around her waist, pulling her in close. Before she could say anything else, he kissed her. 
<br /> 
<br /> 
<br /></p>

<h4 id="chapter-three">Chapter Three</h4>

<p><strong>Or at least he</strong> <em>seemed</em> to kiss her. As he leaned in, Dallas cradled Rourkeâ€™s face in his hand and eased his thumb over her lips. He dipped her, turning her slightly away from the rest of the room â€“ and kissed his thumb.</p>

<p>â€œWhat are you doing?â€ she mumbled in alarm.</p>

<p>â€œItâ€™s called a stage kiss,â€ he whispered. â€œThis is how we do it in theater class.â€ He opened one eye to peek at her. â€œDo you think it looks real enough?â€</p>

<p>â€œDalâ€¦â€</p>

<p>â€œTry to sell it, Merry, please?â€</p>

<p>â€œSell it?â€</p>

<p>â€œPut your arms around me. Close your eyes. And donâ€™t just stand there like a statue. <em>Relax</em>.â€</p>

<p><em>Relax?!</em> Rourke thought. <em>Ha!</em> Easy for him to say. He didnâ€™t know what it was like for her to be in this position. So close to him. Wrapped in his warm, rock-hard arms. Being almost-kissed. The whole thing was making her dizzy. The only reason Dallas could expect Rourke to relax in this situation was because he didnâ€™t have a clue how she really felt about him. He didnâ€™t know she was desperately in love with him. That she had been for years and years and years nowâ€¦</p>

<p>Not that it would have mattered to him if heâ€™d known. Dallas fooled around with girls all the time, but he never got involved with any of them. He was a player. Oh sure, he was a kind enough person and a great friend, butâ€¦he wasnâ€™t looking for love, especially not with Rourke. To him, she was just little â€œMerryâ€ Featherstone, his childhood pal. His buddy. His â€œlittle sis,â€ as heâ€™d just called her. Rourke had resigned herself to that truth ages ago, but a part of her had never stopped wishing things could be different.</p>

<p>â€œCome on,â€ Dallas urged, and ran his free hand up Rourkeâ€™s back. â€œLoosen up, Merry.â€</p>

<p>Rourke closed her eyes, wishing with all her heart that Dallas wasnâ€™t just play-acting right now. That his thumb wasnâ€™t in the way and his lips were actually caressing hers. Most of all, she wished he were kissing because he was as crazy for her as she was for him. But he wasnâ€™t. He was only faking it for some reason. The thought was disheartening. She brought her hands up to push him away and spare herself the pain, but thenâ€¦as her hands made contact with his shoulders, she realized something. This pretend kiss, whatever the reason for it might be, was probably the closest Rourke was ever going to get to the real thing; she probably ought to at least enjoy it while it lasted.</p>

<p><em>Sell it</em>, heâ€™d said? Well, okay.</p>

<p>Sighing, she moved in closer, pressing her body up against his the way the ladies in romance novels were always doing to the men they were hopelessly in love with (the way she assumed Lady Melody would do to Josef just as soon she sorted everything out about him) and wound her arms around Dallasâ€™s neck, plunging one hand into his thick, dark hair.</p>

<p>â€œMmm, thatâ€™s better,â€ he whispered.</p>

<p>His voice was husky, and at the sound of it, Rourke melted. Her knees went weak and she faltered against him. He responded by wrapping his arm tighter around her, practically holding her up. She was so close to him now that she could feel him, his strength and his heat, and she could <em>smell</em> him, too, his freshly-scrubbed body and clean hairâ€¦Rourkeâ€™s temperature rose. Her pulse began to beat faster and faster. Her consciousness went fuzzy, but in a pleasant, blissful way, and thenâ€¦</p>

<p>â€œUhhhfâ€¦.â€ Rourke stumbled as Dallas abruptly let her go. She reeled back, just managing to catch herself against a bookshelf. She looked up to see that he was grinning at her, his eyes alight with amusement. â€œUm, h-how was that?â€ she asked him, surprised by how breathless she sounded.</p>

<p>â€œExcellent,â€ he smirked. â€œRemind me to introduce you to the drama teacher later. I think you may have a future as an incredible actress.â€</p>

<p>â€œOh, umâ€¦great,â€ she muttered.</p>

<p>A cagey look came into his eyes. He turned and peeked around the bookcase, sweeping his gaze around the Center.</p>

<p>â€œDal, what is this all about?â€ she wondered, her heart still leaping about frantically, threatening to escape her chest.</p>

<p>â€œJennifer Tiplady,â€ he said out of the side of his mouth.</p>

<p>â€œWho?â€</p>

<p>â€œThe blonde in the tight t-shirt. Didnâ€™t you see her?â€</p>

<p>â€œNo. Who is she?â€</p>

<p>He shrugged irritably. â€œJust the latest girl to become obsessed with me. Iâ€™ve told her Iâ€™m not interested but she still follows me around everywhere I go. She was in here, skulking around, and I figured if she saw me kissing someone else, maybe itâ€™d convince her to finally give up on me.â€</p>

<p>Rourke felt her heart begin to calm down, dropping a few centimeters inside her chest. â€œOh,â€ she said, straightening her shirt. â€œDo you think it worked?â€</p>

<p>â€œMaybe. She seems to have split.â€</p>

<p>Dallas turned back to her and smiled, smoothing his hair where Rourke had rumpled it. Watching him, she ached to be close to him again, wishing he would pull her back into his arms and give her another fake kiss. Or better yet, a real one. Because as unlikely as it was to happen â€“ and as pathetic as she knew it was to get her hopes up about it â€“ there was no use pretending that wasnâ€™t what sheâ€™d been longing for from the moment sheâ€™d discovered sheâ€™d be moving back here. So many times over the past few months, the idea of something <em>happening</em> with Dallas once they were reunited had been the only thing keeping Rourke going. The only thing that had made the move back to Carreen seem at all worthwhile.</p>

<p>But there was no second kiss, real or otherwise. Just an affectionate cuff under her chin as Dallas said, â€œThanks for the help, Mer. I owe you a big, greasy slice of cheese pizza.â€ Then he winked at her and turned, strutting back to the table â€“ where Clinton and Maddison sat staring at the two of them in sheer horror. 
<br /> 
<br /></p>

<p><strong>Actually, <em>everyone</em> in the</strong> room seemed to be staring at them. Not that Rourke was surprised. Theyâ€™d all just witnessed the hottest guy in school making out with some short, funny-looking new girl. A new girl who, thanks to Maddisonâ€™s earlier outburst, everyone believed was his <em>little sister</em>. Rourke cringed as she slunk back into her seat and caught the flabbergasted look on Maddisonâ€™s face. Clinton was frowning, too. Only Lauren seemed unfazed, but then again she didnâ€™t seem to have looked up from her laptop.</p>

<p>Clinton was the one to finally break the awkward silence. â€œClose family?â€ he asked drily.</p>

<p>Rourke rolled her eyes. â€œDal just does that sometimes because he thinks itâ€™s funny. Donâ€™t you, Dal, you big joker?â€ She swatted his bicep â€“ impressed anew by its solidity.</p>

<p>â€œDoes what?â€ said Maddison, swallowing. She looked a little gray, and as though she might be about to throw up. â€œTongue-kisses his little sister in public-?â€</p>

<p>â€œNo,â€ Rourke was shaking her head. â€œNonono, Iâ€™m <em>not</em> his sister. He just likes to call me that. As a joke.â€</p>

<p>Maddisonâ€™s frown deepened.</p>

<p>â€œUgh,â€ Rourke said. â€œDal, can I get a little help here, please-?â€</p>

<p>Dallas was smirking, radiating amusement. â€œWhy?â€ he asked. â€œYouâ€™re doing so well on your own.â€ But finally he yielded to Rourkeâ€™s pleading look. Chuckling, he told Maddison, â€œFine, sheâ€™s not really my sister. But our parents were married once.â€</p>

<p>â€œForever ago,â€ Rourke hurried to add. â€œFor less than a year, when we were six.â€</p>

<p>â€œAnd then our parents got separated,â€ Dallas said, â€œand Merry and her family moved into her grandmaâ€™s house down the block from me. For a while there, we were neighbors. Played together every day.â€</p>

<p>â€œAnd watched all seven seasons of his dadâ€™s <em>TNG</em> collection,â€ Rourke blurted out, â€œstart to finish.â€</p>

<p>Maddisonâ€™s brow crinkled in confusion. â€œ<em>Tâ€¦NG</em>?â€</p>

<p>â€œ<em>Star Trek:  The Next Generation</em>,â€ Rourke clarified.</p>

<p>â€œ<em>Star Trek</em>?â€ Maddison shot a glance at Dallas. Her mouth curled with amusement. â€œYou mean you guys are, like, Trekkies or something?â€</p>

<p>Rourkeâ€™s face flushed in response to the derision in the other girlâ€™s tone. But then she sat up straighter, lifting her chin. â€œDepends on who you ask,â€ she said. â€œSome people prefer the term Trekk<em>ers</em>. And anyway, Dal and I only got so into the show because his dad was super strict. He wouldnâ€™t really let us watch anything elseâ€“â€</p>

<p>Dallas laid a hand on her shoulder, jostling her gently until she shut up. He flashed a quick, admonitory frown. â€œMerry, Merry, whatâ€™re you doing? Blowing my cover already? I told you, no one here knows Iâ€™m a geek.â€</p>

<p>She looked up at him, blinking. â€œOh, right, sorry.â€</p>

<p>He grinned, shaking his head softly, and redirected his attention to the others. â€œAnyway, Merry moved away when we were eight.â€</p>

<p>â€œBecause my mom divorced his dad,â€ Rourke added.</p>

<p>â€œMy dad divorced your mom,â€ Dallas corrected.</p>

<p>â€œSame thing,â€ Rourke said.</p>

<p>â€œNo, it isnâ€™t. Saying your mom divorced him makes it sound like it was his fault but we both know it wasnâ€™t.â€</p>

<p>Rourke blushed again, because she knew he was right. Her mother had been the one to cheat on Dallasâ€™s dad. Sheâ€™d done the same thing to Rourkeâ€™s father once, as well. Linda had never married Juliaâ€™s dad, but Rourke didnâ€™t doubt that if she had, sheâ€™d have made his life miserable, eventually cheated on him, and then divorced him, too. It was sort of her thing. â€œOkay,â€ she conceded. â€œBut the really important thing right now is that you and I arenâ€™t â€“ and never were â€“ actually related. Only through marriage. A marriage that no longer exists and hasnâ€™t for almost ten years.â€</p>

<p>Maddison exhaled. A bit of color returned to her face. Then she perked up with excitement, clapping her hands. â€œOh my gosh, so you guys are like Cher and Josh in <em>Clueless</em>!â€</p>

<p>â€œWho?â€ said Dallas, â€œIn what?â€ Because he generally only liked movies where people and/or cars and/or space ships got blown to smithereens.</p>

<p>â€œNo, not really,â€ Rourke said. Because while she enjoyed watching things explode as much as the next person, she loved movies adapted from Jane Austen novels almost as much. She had probably seen every one ever made. Twice.</p>

<p>â€œWhy not?â€ Maddison asked, blinking.</p>

<p><em>Because Dal and I are never going to end up together the way Cher and Josh did</em>, Rourke thought miserably. Out loud, she said, â€œWell, umâ€¦Dal and I donâ€™t really bicker like those two. Weâ€™ve pretty much always gotten along.â€</p>

<p>â€œWe bonded over the fact that we both have uncommon, sort of ridiculous, slightly pretentious first names,â€ Dallas said.</p>

<p>â€œOoh,â€ Clinton held up his hand, â€œcan I join that club?â€</p>

<p>Rourke darted a glance at him. â€œClintonâ€™s not a bad name.â€</p>

<p>He smiled uneasily. â€œThanks. But everyone thinks Iâ€™m named after Hillaryâ€™s husband just because I was born while he was still in office.â€</p>

<p>â€œYeah, well, at least your name doesnâ€™t rhyme with anythingâ€¦unfortunate, the way mine does,â€ Rourke countered.</p>

<p>Maddison blinked at her. â€œLike what?â€</p>

<p>Rourke sighed. â€œWell, â€˜porkâ€™ for one thing, and I went through sort of a chubby phase.â€</p>

<p>â€œOh, no,â€ Maddison laughed, covering her mouth.</p>

<p>â€œAlso, everyone thinks Iâ€™m named after that weird guy with those electric whips in <em>Iron Man 2</em>, when really â€˜Rourkeâ€™ is just some dumb old family name.â€</p>

<p>â€œWhat about me?â€ Dallas asked. â€œEveryone always asks me if Dallas is where I was conceived.â€</p>

<p>Maddison widened her eyes, grinning. â€œIs it?â€</p>

<p>â€œNo,â€ Rourke started to answer for him, â€œheâ€™s named afterâ€“â€</p>

<p>But Dallas cut her off:  â€œUh, never mind that. The point is Rourke and I have been close for a really long time. All these years weâ€™ve been apart, weâ€™ve almost always stayed in touch.â€</p>

<p>Rourke nodded. â€œYeah, at first we wrote each other postcards and letters.â€</p>

<p>â€œBut then we pretty much moved our friendship online. You know, email and such.â€</p>

<p>â€œWe text and IM all the time.â€</p>

<p>â€œAnd we video chat at least once a week.â€</p>

<p>â€œAw, and you practically finish one anotherâ€™s sentences, too,â€ Clinton interjected in a syrupy tone. â€œOh, but donâ€™t worry you guys, it isnâ€™t nauseating. <em>At all</em>.â€</p>

<p>Dallas flashed the other boy his middle finger, but Clinton just laughed.</p>

<p>Maddison looked from Dallas to Rourke and then from Rourke to Dallas again. Her lower lip protruded. â€œDallas Mackenzie,â€ she said reproachfully, â€œare you telling me that all these years â€“ while every girl in the Carreen school system was steadily falling in love with you â€“ youâ€™ve had a secret long-distance girlfriend?!â€</p>

<p>â€œGirlfriend?â€ Dallasâ€™s brow furrowed. â€œNo. I mean, Merry and Iâ€¦â€ He shot a glance at Rourke. â€œWell, weâ€™re not involved that way. Weâ€™re just friends.â€</p>

<p>Poor Maddison looked like her head was about ready to explode. She pressed her fingertips to her temple. â€œWhat do you mean youâ€™re <em>just friends</em>?! You just planted the worldâ€™s most passionate kiss on her over there by the reference section-!â€</p>

<p>Dallas grinned, catching on. â€œOh, no, that? That was only pretend.â€</p>

<p>â€œ<em>Pretend?</em> Why?!â€</p>

<p>â€œLong story,â€ he told her. â€œAnd wait a second, <em>every</em> girl here is in love with me?â€ He toyed with the leather cuff buckled around his wrist, looking Maddison over with a devilish grin. â€œSince when?â€</p>

<p>Maddison lowered her gaze. She seemed pleasantly flustered by Dallasâ€™s attention. Clinton on the other hand, had begun to look annoyed.</p>

<p>â€œNow that the reunionâ€™s over with, can we get down to business?â€ he huffed at Dallas. â€œI still need to go over some stuff with your sister-slash-girlfriend here before the first bell rings.â€</p>

<p>Rourke could feel her temperature rising. She tucked her hair behind her ears, debating whether or not to correct him again.</p>

<p>Maddison distracted her by saying, â€œWait a second. Rourke, you still havenâ€™t explained why Dallas calls you Mary.â€</p>

<p>Rourke shook her head. â€œItâ€™s not Mary, itâ€™sâ€¦â€</p>

<p>â€œMerry.â€ Dallas spread his arms. â€œAs in Christmas. As in eat, drink, and be!â€</p>

<p>â€œItâ€™s short for Meredith,â€ Rourke admitted reluctantly. â€œI read it in some book as a kid and used to think it was the prettiest name in the entire world.â€</p>

<p>Dallas hooked his hand over the back of Rourkeâ€™s chair. â€œWhen we were small, she came home one day, bawling her eyes out over the kids at school calling her â€˜Rourke the dorkâ€™ or some stupid thing. She wanted to change her name, tried to get everyone to call her Meredith instead.â€</p>

<p>â€œOnly Dal went along with it,â€ Rourke said. â€œBut then he shortened it to Merry for some reason, and it stuck.â€</p>

<p>â€œWell it does seem to fit,â€ Dallas said, tugging playfully on a lock of Rourkeâ€™s hair. â€œWeâ€™ve always had such a rip-roaring good time together.â€</p>

<p>Maddison chuckled, batting her eyelashes. â€œAw, thatâ€™s sweet,â€ she sighed. She checked the time on her phone and then stood up. As if attached by a tether, Lauren also stood, closing down her laptop and slipping it into her bag. â€œI have to go,â€ Maddison said, â€œbut it was nice meeting you, Rourke. Maybe weâ€™ll see each other later. What classes did you get stuck with?â€</p>

<p>Clinton sighed and shoved his phone at Maddison, who took it and began scrolling. Her face lit up as she perused Rourkeâ€™s schedule. â€œOoh, we have AP History together!â€</p>

<p>Rourke sat up straighter, jolted by the other girlâ€™s enthusiasm. â€œUm, is that a good class?â€</p>

<p>Maddison scowled. â€œNo, itâ€™s actually pretty brutal. But our regular teacher, Mrs. Giarardini? Delivered her baby prematurely and had to take her maternity leave early. So we have a sub for the rest of the semester. Mr. M. Youâ€™re going to love him. Heâ€™s cool, and for an old guy heâ€™s pretty damn tasty.â€</p>

<p>Clinton groaned and rubbed his forehead.</p>

<p>â€œOh, heâ€™s also Clintonâ€™s uncle,â€ Maddison added.</p>

<p>â€œAnd practically yours, too,â€ Clinton said.</p>

<p>Maddison ran her thumb over the phone, looking at Rourkeâ€™s schedule instead of at him. â€œUm, <em>no</em>. Just because my aunt is married to one of Mr. Mâ€™s best friends does <em>not</em> make him my uncle. Thank God.â€</p>

<p>Clinton frowned. â€œYeah, but you know heâ€™s married, right? To my <em>aunt</em>. And anyone whoâ€™s ever seen the two of them together knows heâ€™s completely nuts about her.â€</p>

<p>Maddison made a face. â€œDo you guys hear something?â€ she asked Rourke and Dallas. Then, turning to glare at Clinton, she muttered, â€œOh yeah. That was Clinton. Being a buzz-kill as usual!â€</p>

<p>Clinton, looking mortified, held out his hand. â€œCan I please have my phone back?â€</p>
