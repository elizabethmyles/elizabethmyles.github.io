<p><em>â€œI donâ€™t know, you guys,â€ I said. â€œIâ€™m starting to worry Iâ€™m not cut out for this relationship stuff. You know, not if itâ€™s going to be this complicated.â€</em></p>

<p><em>â€œWhatâ€™s that mean?â€ asked Lia.</em></p>

<p><em>â€œIt means I have no idea what Iâ€™m doing!â€ I said. â€œBooks and movies always end with â€˜happily ever after.â€™ You know, right when the relationshipâ€™s getting started? I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s supposed to come after that. And judging by how things are going with Jake so far, Iâ€™m not doing a very good job of winging itâ€¦â€</em></p>

<p>Veronicaâ€™s having a busy senior year. When sheâ€™s not at school or working at the Maribel Movie Palace, sheâ€™s writing concert reviews for her zine, <em>The Blank Slate</em>, or helping her best friend, Lia, entertain her new famous friend, Clyde Kameron. Sheâ€™s even designing special effects for Liaâ€™s boyfriend, Jonathanâ€™s, indie horror film.</p>

<p>And oh, yeah, sheâ€™s also dating her first-ever boyfriend, Jakeâ€”a sweet, smart, amazingly gifted musician who seems completely serious about her. So serious, heâ€™s already talking about spending the rest of his life with her. But after her parentsâ€™ messy divorce, Veronicaâ€™s not so sure she believes in â€œhappily ever after,â€ or that she has the relationship know-how to make it happen.</p>

<p>Not that it necessarily matters.</p>

<p>Despite his apparent devotion, Veronicaâ€™s beginning to think Jake wonâ€™t really stick around forever. When he gets an offer to go out on tour with his band, she canâ€™t help but wonder how long it will be until he leaves town and forgets all about her. Especially since, if he accepts the offer, heâ€™ll be out on the road with his ex-girlfriendâ€”a voluptuous and talented drummer with an obvious lingering crush on Jakeâ€”and a ton of groupies chasing after him.</p>

<p>And Jakeâ€™s not the only one whose exes are causing headaches. Soon Layne Maxwell, a boy from Veronicaâ€™s past, is back in town, seemingly determined to make trouble for her.</p>
