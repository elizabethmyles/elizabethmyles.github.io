<h4 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h4>

<p>Jake Mlinarich and I were alone together in the back of his van, parked behind the club where his band, Good Television, was scheduled to go on stage soon. He touched my hand and looked over at me, a lock of his rust colored hair slipping down over one of his blue-gray eyes. â€œNic,â€ he said, â€œthereâ€™s something I want to give you.â€</p>

<p>I smiled because I loved hearing him call me that, â€˜Nic,â€™ instead of Veronica the way everyone else did. It was his special nickname for me and reminded me that I was special to him, too. I was his girlfriend. For almost two months now.</p>

<p>I put my hand on his leg. â€œWhat, like a present?â€ I asked, jokingly, because Jake had never given me any presents before. Well, other than a mix tape once, way back before weâ€™d been dating. Heâ€™d even warned me since then that he wasnâ€™t really a â€œpresent-giving type of guy.â€</p>

<p>So I was surprised when he answered, â€œYeah. A present.â€</p>

<p>â€œHuh?â€ I glanced around the van, hunting for the gift. Jakeâ€™s keys were in the ignition and the lights were on, but I couldnâ€™t see a thing aside from my backpack slumped in one corner and the ratty old blanket we were sitting on. â€œWhere is it?â€ I wondered.</p>

<p>An impish smile touched his lips. â€œIn my pants.â€</p>

<p>I drew my hand away from his leg. â€œExcuse me?â€</p>

<p>He pointed at his jeans pocket. â€œIn here. Close your eyes. And put out your hands.â€</p>

<p>I squeezed my eyes shut and reached out, feeling him settle something onto my palm. When he told me I could look, I saw I was holding a black velvet box with a rounded, hinged lid. â€œOh,â€ I gasped, and dropped it.</p>

<p>â€œHey, watch it,â€ Jake complained as the box bounced across the floor.</p>

<p>â€œWhat is that?!â€</p>

<p>â€œJust a little anniversary present. Two months since we got together.â€ He recovered the box, dusting it carefully on his jeans. â€œTechnically thatâ€™s not until tomorrow, but whatever. Here.â€</p>

<p>He held the box out to me again. I tucked my hands behind my back. â€œDonâ€™t you think itâ€™s a little soon for this type of present?â€ I asked warily.</p>

<p>â€œWhat type?â€ Jake asked. â€œYou just said you donâ€™t even know what it is.â€</p>

<p>He was right, I didnâ€™t; but I could take a guess. I mean, what else could possibly be in a box that looked like that? It had to be jewelry. But it was the wrong shape and size to hold a bracelet. And for some reason, I couldnâ€™t imagine Jake giving me a pair of earrings. That meant whatever was in the box wasâ€¦some sort of ring. Not an engagement ring or anything. That would be silly after only dating for a couple of months. But for all I knew it might be a pre-engagement ring.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d learned about pre-engagement rings from this girl Iâ€™d had gym class with the previous year, Janna Hoff. When my best friend, Lia, had asked her about the tiny gold and diamond band sheâ€™d worn around her left ring finger, Janna had told her it meant she was â€œengaged-to-be-engagedâ€ to the guy whoâ€™d given it to her. His name was Frank and he was on the Science Bowl team.</p>

<p>Janna had always seemed kind of stuck up to me but hearing her talk about Frank that day had made me think she might not be such a giant snob after all. I mean, sheâ€™d seemed to think Frank was a real catch just on account of his being smart and nice and wanting a commitment and everything. She hadnâ€™t seemed to care at all that he was super short and not very cute, or that he was bow-legged and had buck teeth. Iâ€™d started to think maybe I was the snob, because I wasnâ€™t sure I couldâ€™ve overlooked all that in a guy, no matter how nice he was. Luckily I didnâ€™t have to.</p>

<p>I glanced over at Jake again, marveling at the fact that my first-ever boyfriend had turned out to be such a gorgeous specimen. He was six foot one, had those beautiful blue-grey eyes, the cutest lips Iâ€™d ever seen, perfectly straight legs and perfectly straight teethâ€¦</p>

<p>â€œHello?â€ he waved at me. â€œNic? Whatâ€™re you staring at?â€</p>

<p>I gulped, gazing at his rumpled Brutal Juice t-shirt and hoping heâ€™d take it off soon. Because he also had an incredible chest. â€œHm?â€ I said. â€œOhâ€¦nothing. Whatâ€™d you say was in the box again?â€</p>

<p>Jake laughedâ€”he had a sexy laugh, tooâ€”and said, â€œAlready told you. Just a little anniversary present. Nothing big. Jeez, why are you so worked up about it?â€</p>

<p>â€œMaybe because I didnâ€™t even know we were doing presents!â€ I said, my voice hitting a high note. â€œI thought weâ€™d agreed to celebrate by going to see Evil Dead II at the Maribel tomorrow night-?â€</p>

<p>He lifted his strong chin, narrowing his eyes. â€œSo youâ€™re saying you donâ€™t want my present?â€</p>

<p>â€œUmmm,â€ I twisted my hands, which had begun to sweat, and asked myself if I wanted a ring from Jake. I was pretty sure I didnâ€™t NOT want it. I was completely, totally in love with the guyâ€”although I hadnâ€™t told him that yet. But what if wearing his ring meant we were engaged-to-be-engaged, like Janna and bow-legged Frank? Was I ready for that? I was only seventeen and Iâ€™d never planned on getting married so young. In fact, Iâ€™d never planned on getting married at all. My friend Paige, who liked to psycho-analyze people, thought I was â€œcommitment-phobicâ€ and said it was probably because when I was eight my parents had gotten a â€œmessyâ€ divorce. I guessed she was right. When my parents had split, thereâ€™d been lots of screaming and yelling and heated visits to lawyersâ€™ offices, and then my dad had left and Iâ€™d hardly ever seen him again. When heâ€™d walked out on my mom Iâ€™d decided no guy was ever going to do that to me. Because I wasnâ€™t going to give him the chance.</p>

<p>Not that Iâ€™d really had to worry about anyone asking me to marry him, though. Guys Iâ€™d hooked up with hadnâ€™t seemed very interested in asking me to be their girlfriend, much less their wife.</p>

<p>That is, until Jake had come back to town.</p>

<p>Jake was Liaâ€™s older brother. Heâ€™d graduated while Lia and I were still sophomores and moved away from our hometown of Carreen, Texas, to go to college in Austin. A few months agoâ€”the summer before my senior yearâ€”heâ€™d surprised everyone by suddenly dropping out of his pre-med program and moving back in with his parents. Lia had just organized a benefit concert to try and save our favorite hang-out, Lynchâ€™s, from going under, and weâ€™d formed a band with Paige called Impressionable Youth to headline the show. Jake joined up as our guitarist. Between band rehearsals and his giving me a ride to school every day, Iâ€™d started to get to know him a little better. And to fall for him. Hard. Iâ€™d thought it would never amount to anything because he was older, smarter, cuter, and cooler than meâ€”in other words, way out of my leagueâ€”but then the craziest things had happened:  heâ€™d kissed me! And told me he liked me, too. So much so that heâ€™d asked me to be his girlfriend! Now here we were two months later and not only did he still seem to want me around, he was holding out this ring box and looking at me all longingly and tenderly andâ€¦</p>

<p>Well, not anymore, actually. Now he just kind of looked annoyed with me.</p>

<p>â€œNic?â€ He pushed the box toward me. â€œDo you want the thing or not?â€</p>

<p>â€œUmmm,â€ I said again, because even though I was crazy about Jake, the thought of getting married still scared the bejeezus out of me.</p>

<p>Jakeâ€™s face twitched with frustration. â€œWhatâ€™re you so afraid of? Itâ€™s not like itâ€™s a ring or anything.â€ Then his eyes widened with understanding. â€œOh. Wait. Is that really what you thought-?â€</p>

<p>â€œNO,â€ I said, feeling simultaneously relieved and stupid beyond belief. Of course it wasnâ€™t a ring! Weâ€™d only been together for two months! â€œHa, ha,â€ I said. â€œPlease.â€</p>

<p>Jakeâ€™s eyes shone with amusement. â€œYou want to marry me.â€</p>

<p>â€œAs if.â€ I shook my head frantically and put my hand out, but he whisked the box away, cradling it against his chest.</p>

<p>â€œYeah you do,â€ he insisted. â€œYou want to marry me and have a dozen fat little babies that all look exactly like meâ€¦â€</p>

<p>â€œOh, God,â€ I groaned, â€œwhatever.â€</p>

<p>He teased me a while longer, holding the box up over my head, but I finally managed to snatch it away from him and thumb it open. As Iâ€™d expected, there was a tiny velvet pillow inside, with a furrow in the center where a piece of jewelry would normally be nestled. But instead of earrings or whatever, there was justâ€¦a guitar pick. Jake played guitar in Good Television, so this sort of made sense. Sort of.</p>

<p>â€œYour pick?â€ I said, puzzled. He touched my hand, tilting the box, and the pick slid aside, letting me see it was strung on a delicate chain along with a thin silver disk about the size of a dime.</p>

<p>â€œSee?â€ he said. â€œTold you it wasnâ€™t anything big. Although the chain and charm are â€˜genuine sterling silver.â€™â€</p>

<p>I lifted the necklace out of the box, letting it dangle from my fingers. The pick was black and scuffed around the edges, like itâ€™d been used a few times.</p>

<p>â€œThatâ€™s the pick I used at Lynchâ€™s final show,â€ he said, nudging me. â€œYou remember that night?â€</p>

<p>â€œAre you kidding?â€ I breathed. As if I could ever forget. The night Lynchâ€™s had permanently shut its doors (because, unfortunately, Liaâ€™s benefit concert hadnâ€™t raised enough money to rescue it) was also the night Jake and I had finally, really gotten together. I say â€œreally,â€ because weâ€™d made out once before that, but like an idiot Iâ€™d told Jake it hadnâ€™t meant anything to me. Iâ€™d thought Iâ€™d completely blown my chances with him until heâ€™d taken me out on a special date right after Lynchâ€™s final show. The first show heâ€™d ever played with Good Television. Using the very guitar pick I was now holding in my hand.</p>

<p>â€œI canâ€™t believe you kept this,â€ I said, my lower lip starting to quiver.</p>

<p>â€œYeah, well,â€ he shrugged like it was no big deal, â€œI know itâ€™s not a ring, butâ€¦you like it?â€</p>

<p>â€œOh, Jake,â€ I breathed, â€œitâ€™sâ€¦I love it.â€</p>

<p>â€œCheck out the medallion,â€ he directed, pointing. I examined the silver disk and saw a monogram engraved on it: a J and a V, with a big M in the middle, linking the other two initials together. â€œSince, you know, both our last names start with an Mâ€¦hey, are you crying?â€</p>

<p>â€œNo,â€ I said, blinking fast. My hand shook as I held the necklace out to him. â€œWould you help me put it on?â€</p>

<p>â€œI know we hadnâ€™t talked about presents,â€ he said, fastening the clasp. â€œI just wantedâ€¦â€</p>

<p>I turned and interrupted him with a kiss. â€œItâ€™s beautiful,â€ I said afterward. â€œThank you.â€</p>

<p>â€œSure thing,â€ he whispered, looking pleased. Then he cleared his throat and added, â€œLook, Nic, I, uhâ€¦â€ He held my gaze for a moment, giving me the feeling he wanted to say something else. Something important.</p>

<p>â€œYeah?â€ I prompted.</p>

<p>He lowered his eyes and hooked his finger in the V-neck of my new black sweater. â€œI like this,â€ he said. â€œIt looks really good on you.â€</p>

<p>â€œOh. Cool,â€ I said, feeling justified in having dropped almost half my latest paycheck on the sweater. Normally I didnâ€™t like to spend a lot of money on clothes. Or on anything, really, because I was saving up to buy a car. But the sweater had been on sale and Iâ€™d thought Jake might like it.</p>

<p>â€œLooks a little complicated, though, with all these buttons.â€ He tugged at my collar. â€œDoes it come off easy?â€</p>

<p>â€œWhat?â€ I said, feeling my face heat up.</p>

<p>â€œYou heard me,â€ he said, smiling.</p>

<p>â€œWellâ€¦I guess thatâ€™s for me to know,â€ I said coolly.</p>

<p>â€œAnd me to find out. Câ€™mere.â€ He pulled me down onto the blanket with him and rolled over on top of me. His fingers were working deftly, teasing open the second button on the sweater when I put my hand over his to stop him.</p>

<p>â€œHey, did you hear that noise?â€ I asked. â€œIt sounded like footsteps right outside. And voicesâ€¦â€</p>

<p>â€œYou watch too many scary movies,â€ he admonished.</p>

<p>He was right. Horror movies were my favorites and I probably did spend way too much time watching them. But I was sure Iâ€™d heard something. â€œMaybe we should just peek out and check?â€ I suggested.</p>

<p>â€œNah,â€ Jake said, â€œit was probably just the wind.â€ Then he gave up on unbuttoning the sweater and just slipped his hand straight up it.</p>

<p>â€œOhâ€¦mmm, ha, ha,â€ I giggled as his fingers found their target.</p>

<p>â€œQuit squirming,â€ he scolded, but in a playful way.</p>

<p>â€œWell, your handâ€™s cold!â€ I scolded back.</p>

<p>â€œDonâ€™t worry,â€ he assured me, â€œweâ€™ll both be plenty warm in a sec.â€</p>

<p>No doubt, I thought, and my pulse sped up.</p>

<p>Then there was a loud knock on the van that made us both jump. â€œJake? Câ€™mon, man, open up!â€</p>

<p>â€œJake, that is not the wind,â€ I said. â€œThatâ€™sâ€¦â€</p>

<p>â€œCaleb,â€ Jake finished, dropping his head onto my shoulder. Caleb Mendez was Jakeâ€™s bassist, best friend, and housemate. He was also, Jake had informed me, under strict orders not to interrupt us tonight unless it was for a very good (i.e., band-related) reason.</p>

<p>â€œThought you guys werenâ€™t going on until nine?â€ I asked, glancing at my watch. It was seven forty-five.</p>

<p>â€œWeâ€™re not,â€ Jake said. â€œWhat the hell does he want?â€</p>

<p>The van doors rattled as Caleb pounded on them again. Jake rolled off me, groaning.</p>

<p>â€œWell, youâ€™d better go find out before he has a conniption,â€ I said, re-fastening my buttons. â€œAnd donâ€™t look so gloomy, huh? You know weâ€™ll just pick up where we left off next time.â€</p>

<p>â€œNext time?â€ He sat up. â€œWhenâ€™s that going to be?â€</p>

<p>â€œMaybe tomorrow?â€ I said, sitting up, too. â€œAfter the movie?â€ I scratched his chest playfully through his shirt, trying to get him to smile. It didnâ€™t work.</p>

<p>â€œYour momâ€™s never going to let you stay out that late,â€ he groused. â€œYouâ€™re probably pushing it already, just by asking to go to a midnight show.â€</p>

<p>â€œJAKE!â€ Caleb shouted.</p>

<p>â€œWould you hold your horses?!â€ Jake shouted back. Then he walked his fingers inside my sweater and picked at the center of my bra. â€œJust so weâ€™re clearâ€¦whereâ€™d you say we were picking up next time? Here?â€</p>

<p>â€œWeâ€™ll see,â€ I said, biting my lip.</p>

<p>â€œSorry,â€ he said, bending closer, â€œwhat was that?â€ He nuzzled my neck, simultaneously tickling me with his free hand.</p>

<p>â€œAck!â€ I shrieked, giggling. â€œI said weâ€™ll see!â€</p>

<p>â€œYeah,â€ he relented, smiling as he gave the bra another tug. â€œWe will.â€ Then he was at the doors, swinging them open. â€œWhat the hell, man?â€ he demanded.</p>

<p>â€œSorry, man,â€ I heard Caleb answer. I turned, squinting against the bright parking lot lights, and saw him standing out there next to Good Televisionâ€™s drummer, Keith Lutz.</p>

<p>â€œI told him!â€ Keith pointed his drum sticks at Caleb. â€œI told him when the van was rocking, not to bother knocking. Everyone knows you just donâ€™t do that. They print it on bumper stickers and everything! Oh, hey, Veronica.â€ He leaned into the van, craning his neck around Jake to peer at me. â€œWow, you look great! You oughtta wear really tight sweaters more oftenâ€¦â€</p>

<p>Jake thumped Keith in the sternum to shut him up. â€œHey. Eyes up here. Now someone wanna tell me what the hellâ€™s going on? Weâ€™re not supposed to hit the stage for over an hour.â€</p>

<p>Calebâ€™s massive bicep flexed as he raked his fingers through his thick hair. â€œThe Gas Farmers flaked. Weâ€™ve been bumped up a slot. Weâ€™re on next, in, like, ten minutes. We managed to get everything set up in a hurry, butâ€¦â€</p>

<p>â€œTaylorâ€™s totally freaking out anyway,â€ finished Keith, rubbing his chest. â€œWe figured weâ€™d better come out and find you.â€</p>

<p>â€œAre you kidding me?â€ Jake sighed, rubbing his eyes with his palms.</p>

<p>â€œSorry, man,â€ Caleb repeated.</p>

<p>When Jake had sent the guys back to the club, he turned to me. â€œGuess date nightâ€™s over, huh?â€</p>

<p>â€œAll part of dating a rock star,â€ I shrugged. â€œIâ€™m pretty used to it by now.â€</p>

<p>â€œYeah,â€ he lifted one eyebrow sardonically, â€œeveryone wants a taste.â€</p>

<p>I laughed, knowing heâ€™d meant it as a joke, but it was true. Just like every other band heâ€™d ever been in, Good Television was local and unsigned, but around Carreen, Jake may as well have been famous. It seemed everywhere we went people recognized him and wanted to talk to him. Shake his hand. Buy him drinks. It could get pretty overwhelming. Not that I could blame anyone for being so taken with him. He was an amazing human being. Aside from being so beautiful and talented, he was smart. Funny. Kind. All the reasons I loved him, too, with all my heart. I gazed at him, watching him pull a flannel on over his t-shirt, and felt the overwhelming urge to finally tell him so.</p>

<p>â€œWhat now?â€ he laughed when he noticed me staring at him like a love-struck psycho for the second time that night.</p>

<p>I love you! I thought. But when I opened my mouth, all that came out was, â€œUhhâ€¦go on ahead, Iâ€™ll lock up for you.â€</p>

<p>But instead of hurrying off to meet up with the rest of his band, Jake stayed where he was, watching me gather my things. His gaze on meâ€”on the guitar pick hanging from its chainâ€”was intense.</p>

<p>â€œSomething wrong?â€ I asked, touching my new necklace self-consciously.</p>

<p>â€œNo. Everythingâ€™s pretty much perfect, if you ask me.â€</p>

<p>â€œOh. Good,â€ I said. â€œBut donâ€™t you think you should hurry and catch up with the guys? Theyâ€™re waitingâ€¦â€</p>

<p>Before I could finish, he was gathering me to him again, touching my chin, tilting my face up to meet his. â€œLet â€˜em wait,â€ he declared and kissed me again.</p>

<h4 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h4>

<p>Ever since Lynchâ€™s had closed back in September, Good Televisionâ€”or Good TV, as they were starting to be called around townâ€”had had to take gigs wherever they could find them. The place they were playing tonight, The Black Box, was in the seedier part of downtown Carreen and had a bad reputation. Fights broke out there all the time, and the management was known for giving bands the runaround when it came time to pay them. But at least it was all ages. Iâ€™d be able to get in without any hassle.</p>

<p>â€œI should be on the list.â€ I showed my I.D. to the bald guy in a bowling shirt perched on a stool by the clubâ€™s door. â€œVeronica Montez?â€</p>

<p>He marked a line through my name on his clipboard, drew a big X on the back of my hand, and did a quick security check of my backpack. â€œYou here alone tonight, honey?â€ he asked, poking through  my things:  a denim jacket, pens and paper, the couple of school books I hadnâ€™t had a chance to ditch before coming here, and the flashlight Iâ€™d brought along so I could jot down notes in the dark about tonightâ€™s show for Liaâ€™s zine, The Blank Slate.</p>

<p>I shook my head. â€œMy boyfriendâ€™s inside already.â€ After our bonus make-out session back at the van, Iâ€™d finally convinced Jake to go inside ahead of me and join his friends.</p>

<p>â€œWell, stick close to him if you can,â€ the bouncer advised.</p>

<p>â€œMight be a little tough,â€ I smiled, tucking my I.D. back into my pocket. â€œHeâ€™s in the band. Why?â€</p>

<p>The bouncer stroked his goatee. â€œPlace is sold out and The Gas Farmers cancellingâ€™s giving everyone an excuse to act rowdy. Weâ€™ve already had to toss a couple clowns out on their asses and I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if thatâ€™s just the first of it.â€ I laughed, but he looked at me gravely. â€œJust be careful, alright?â€</p>

<p>Once inside, I thought I got a hint of what the bouncer had been talking about. The dim club was teeming with sweaty, frustrated-looking people. There was an anxious vibe in the air. I stood on my toes and looked around until I spotted Calebâ€™s girlfriend, Rylie Mejia and Taylorâ€™s boyfriend, Shane Forillo, sitting together at a high-top table with a great view of the stage.</p>

<p>â€œHey, you!â€ Rylieâ€™s dark eyes lit up behind her glasses when I reached her. She threw her arms around me and then turned to Shane, asking him dryly, â€œWhy donâ€™t you invite Veronica to have a seat, Shane?â€</p>

<p>Shane brushed a few sweaty curls away from his temple, flashing her a dirty look and then me a guilty one. â€œSomeone, uh, stole the bar stool we were saving for you,â€ he admitted to me.</p>

<p>â€œHe means he let someone take it while I went to get a drink,â€ Rylie clarified.</p>

<p>Shane hunched his shoulders defensively. â€œWell, I wasnâ€™t about to say no. That guy was huge. And terrifying.â€</p>

<p>â€œYou just described almost everyone in this place,â€ Rylie told him with a shudder.</p>

<p>â€œIâ€™ll find another seat somewhere,â€ I assured them. â€œI need to grab some caffeine, anyway. Will you guys watch my stuff?â€ I left my things on the table and headed for the bar, keeping an eye out for any empty chairs or stools along the way. There didnâ€™t seem to be any. The bar was crowded, too. I was trying in vain to catch the cross-looking bartenderâ€™s attention when Keith sidled up, holding a bottle of beer.</p>

<p>â€œIf youâ€™re wondering why youâ€™re not having any luck getting a drink,â€ he said, picking up my hand, â€œitâ€™s â€˜cause youâ€™re branded.â€ He traced his thumb over the â€˜Xâ€™ the bouncer had drawn on me. â€œMinors only order free Cokes. Itâ€™s not worth the bartenderâ€™s time. Especially not when itâ€™s this busy and she could be raking in big money from the really hardcore drunks like me.â€ He smiled, showing me the single dimple in his right cheek, and I couldnâ€™t help but smile back.</p>

<p>Keith was an old classmate of Jakeâ€™s and the third drummer Good Television had hired in as many months. Theyâ€™d lost their first one to another band that had gone out on tour, and his replacement had been kicked out because heâ€™d spent more time in jail than at rehearsals. Keith, whoâ€™d been bumming around Austin for the past year or so, had just reappeared in Carreen when the guys had run into him at Rickâ€™s Records and offered him their gig. He was always at least mildly drunk and had what Jake referred to as a â€œsmart mouth,â€ but he was an excellent drummer. And he was cute. He had that dimple, and his nose was crooked, like itâ€™d been broken before. His hair was a light, sandy brown and his dark green eyes tilted down at the corners, giving him a sweet (and, Jake would say, deceptively) innocent puppy-dog look.</p>

<p>â€œThat actually makes a lot of sense,â€ I said, slipping my hand out of his. â€œMaybe I should just forget about it?â€</p>

<p>â€œIâ€™ll get it for you,â€ he offered, lifting his beer to show me it was nearly empty. â€œIâ€™m about to need another hit myself anyway. Whatâ€™s your poison? Wait. I was right, wasnâ€™t I? You just want a Coke?â€</p>

<p>I gave in. â€œA Diet, actually.â€</p>

<p>He flashed the dimple again. â€œWait here.â€ He turned and snaked through the line, somehow maneuvering right up to the bar and immediately getting the bartenderâ€™s attention. Amazed, I watched him chat with her and even get her to crack a smile. Moments later, she followed him back to where I stood, sliding a fresh beer across the bar to Keith and a red plastic tumbler over to me.</p>

<p>â€œHowâ€™d you do that?â€ I asked him when the bartender had scurried off again.</p>

<p>â€œIâ€™m irresistible,â€ he said. â€œHavenâ€™t you noticed?â€ Before I could respond to that with more than just a nervous smile, he laughed and pulled out his wallet, flipping it open to show me a driverâ€™s license that said he was from Oregon and was twenty two years old. â€œIâ€™ve been orderingâ€”and tipping excellently on, I might addâ€”real drinks from her all night.â€</p>

<p>â€œWith a fake I.D.?â€ I said.</p>

<p>â€œI know. I feel terrible about it.â€ His rakish grin brought the blood rushing unexpectedly to my face.</p>

<p>Mortified, I picked up my drink and turned away, pretending fascination with a big, beefy guy standing next to me instead. I stared at the back of the big guyâ€™s head, trying to make out the tattoo just visible beneath his buzz cut. Surprisingly enough, from this angle it kind of looked like a delicate purpleâ€¦butterfly.</p>

<p>â€œSo, uh, how are things going for you?â€ I asked Keith, still not looking directly at him. â€œJake told me you were living with Taylor-?â€ I didnâ€™t mention heâ€™d added that Keith was only crashing with Good TVâ€™s singer because heâ€™d been thrown out of his parentsâ€™ place almost immediately upon moving back inâ€”for what was probably the tenth time since seventh grade.</p>

<p>â€œItâ€™s cool, I guess,â€ he said. â€œTaylorâ€™s a good cook. But Shaneâ€™s a pig. Seems no oneâ€™s ever taught that poor child how to hang up a wet towel. And he leaves his socks and underwear lying around all over the place. Still, itâ€™s better than putting up with my dadâ€™s bullshit. And at least Taylorâ€™s mom comes by every week to do all our laundry and help us pick up after Shane. You know, she usually brings us a pot pie or a casserole or something. Guess I can see where Taylor learned how to cook so goodâ€¦â€</p>

<p>While he was talking, the guy next to me scooped his drink off the bar and lumbered away. Keith quickly eased into the space heâ€™d vacated, forcing me to look at him again. â€œSo, Veronica,â€ he said, gazing at me intently, â€œIâ€™ve been in the band for weeks now and feel like weâ€™ve hardly gotten to know one another yet. Which is a shame â€˜cause Iâ€™ve heard you and I have a lot in common.â€</p>

<p>â€œOh, yeah?â€ I sipped my soda. â€œLike what?â€</p>

<p>â€œLike that youâ€™re a kick-ass drummer, too. Werenâ€™t you in a band a while back? With Jake and that hot sister of his? Whatâ€™s-her-nameâ€¦?â€</p>

<p>â€œLia,â€ I supplied.</p>

<p>Keith nodded, flicking his tongue lightly across his upper lip. â€œYeah. Lia. Manâ€¦guess itâ€™s obvious who got the looks in that family, huh?â€</p>

<p>I swatted his shoulder. â€œHey!â€</p>

<p>Keith chuckled and raised his beer, knocking back what remained of it before swapping it out with his new one. â€œSeriously. Iâ€™ve been thinking of shopping for a new kit soon. You ought to come with me. Share your expertise.â€</p>

<p>I shook my head. â€œIâ€™m no expert.â€ Iâ€™d only played drumsâ€”if you could even call it thatâ€”for about five minutes and Iâ€™d been terrible. Now I was done playing rock star, and perfectly happy to be back on the sidelines where I belonged, writing about shows for The Blank Slate instead of humiliating myself by trying to participate in them.</p>

<p>â€œYou could come along with me anyway,â€ he decided. â€œIâ€™m sure weâ€™d find some way to pass the time.â€ As he said this, he shot a peek straight down the front of my sweater, not even bothering to pretend he wasnâ€™t. Far behind him, near the stage, I spotted Jake at Rylieâ€™s table, talking to her and Shane.</p>

<p>â€œHey, uh, Keith?â€ I said and quickly set my drink on the bar. â€œShouldnâ€™t you be on stage by now?â€</p>

<p>â€œThere was some problem with the lighting holding things up over there,â€ Keith informed my chest. â€œIâ€™m sure Iâ€™ve got a few more minutes to chat.â€</p>

<p>I brought my hand to my neckline, trying to obscure his view. â€œI donâ€™t think thatâ€™s such a good idea,â€ I said. I knew if Jake saw Keith talking to me he wouldnâ€™t be pleased. Heâ€™d told him enough times to stay away from me and vice versaâ€”and I thought I was beginning to understand why. The thing was, Keith said inappropriate things to Rylie all the time, too, but for all his hitting on her and all her grumbling about it, her boyfriend was unlikely to do anything to stop it. As ripped and intimidating-looking as he was, Caleb was shy about confrontation. Unlike Jake, who wouldâ€™ve eagerly snapped Keith in two if he was bothering me. Or if Jake decided he was bothering me. I was contemplating whether Keith was unaware of this fact, or if he was fearless or compulsive or maybe just a little dumb when someone hurrying by elbowed me right in the back.</p>

<p>â€œOof!â€ I said as I lost my balance, tripped over my own foot, and landed squarely against Keithâ€™s chest.</p>

<p>â€œOh, hey. Hello,â€ he said.</p>

<p>â€œGod, I am so sorry!â€ I put my hand on his chest, trying to push away from him, but he wrapped his arm around my waist and held on.</p>

<p>â€œYou okay?â€ he whispered.</p>

<p>â€œYeah,â€ I nodded, trying to ignore the way his breath tickled my ear. And how good his neck smelled. And how firm his chest felt beneath my palm. â€œIâ€™m totally fine.â€</p>

<p>â€œNo kidding.â€ I looked up at the same time he looked down. Our gazes met and I noticed his irises werenâ€™t actually green but hazel, shot through with flecks of gold. I gulped.</p>

<p>â€œCome on, Keith,â€ I said halfheartedly, â€œJake could walk up any secondâ€¦â€</p>

<p>He sighed, his hand sliding to the small of my back. â€œJake, Jake, Jake. What do all you girls see in him, anyway? Is it the van? â€˜Cause I drive one, too, you know. Itâ€™s newer and nicer, and Iâ€™ll bet the backâ€™s comfier than his.â€</p>

<p>â€œKeith.â€</p>

<p>He smirked, his fingers massaging a small circle onto my back. â€œOr is it his pansy-assed, perpetual five-o-clock-shadow? I heard that was your fault. But guess what? I can stop shaving just as easily as he canâ€¦â€</p>

<p>â€œKeith!â€ I wriggled out of his grasp and backed away, straightening my clothes. â€œI have to go. I donâ€™t think Jake would like it if he saw us talking to one another. In fact, I know he wouldnâ€™t.â€</p>

<p>Keith raised his eyebrows, smiling mischievously. â€œWell, whatâ€™s he going to do about it?â€</p>

<p>â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ I sighed, finally giving up because now it was too late, â€œbut I guess you could ask him. Heâ€™s coming up right behind you.â€</p>

<p>Keith turned around slowly, a sheepish grin spreading across his face. â€œHey, Jake! Veronica and I were just talking about you. Have I told you how much I like your new beard? Itâ€™s very, uhâ€¦manly.â€ When Jake advanced toward him, glowering, he continued, hands in the air, â€œWe were just talking, man. Having a nice, friendly conversationâ€¦Câ€™mon, man, calm down.â€ Backing up, he pointed at the glass Iâ€™d recovered from the bar. â€œI was just helping her get a drink!â€</p>

<p>Jake reached him and shoved him aside, sending him stumbling into a nearby table. The girls sitting there all jumped up, shrieking and cursing as Keith toppled their glasses, emptying their drinks into their laps. â€œGet to the stage,â€ Jake commanded as Keith righted himself and started apologizing. â€œEveryoneâ€™s waiting on you.â€ Then he put his hand on my arm and led me away.</p>

<p>â€œWas that really necessary?â€ I asked. Jake didnâ€™t answer. â€œHe really was just trying to help me out,â€ I continued, holding up my soda. It sloshed dangerously as we sped through the crowd back toward Rylieâ€™s table.</p>

<p>â€œBy putting his arm around you?â€ he snapped.</p>

<p>I immediately blushed. â€œYeah, actually. He caught me,â€ I explained. â€œBecause someone else pushed me over. Speaking of which:  I mean it. You didnâ€™t have to knock him down!â€</p>

<p>Jake was unmoved. â€œNot my fault that bum leg of his keeps him from standing up straight. Besides, you donâ€™t have to go to the bar to get drinks. Iâ€™ve told you a dozen times, I can have whatever you want sent straight over to your table.â€</p>

<p>â€œI know, butâ€¦â€</p>

<p>â€œIn case you havenâ€™t noticed, this isnâ€™t the friendliest place. I donâ€™t want you getting hurt or into any trouble. So do me a favor, huh? Stick close to Rylie and Shane and try not to talk to anyone else.â€</p>

<p>â€œButâ€¦â€</p>

<p>Weâ€™d reached Rylieâ€™s table. Jake took the glass out of my hand and set it down so hard a few drops of soda did slosh out of it. â€œVeronica, would you please listen to me?â€</p>

<p>The sound of my full name coming out of his mouth startled me. I looked up, alarmed. â€œJake, whatâ€™s wrong?â€</p>

<p>He closed his eyes for a moment, taking a deep breath and then exhaling through his nose. â€œI donâ€™t knowâ€¦Iâ€™ve got a bad feeling about tonight. First The Gas Farmers cancel. Now everything seems to be going wrong backstage. The crowdâ€™s so pissed off, weâ€™ll be lucky to all get out of here in one piece. I donâ€™t want to have to worry about you, too, okay?â€</p>

<p>â€œAlright, already,â€ I said. â€œSheesh. Iâ€™ll wait for you here.â€</p>

<p>Relief lightened his expression. He kissed my temple and said heâ€™d see me after the show.</p>

<p>â€œGood news,â€ Rylie told me as Jake headed back to the stage. â€œJake wrangled a seat for you.â€ She patted an empty stool next to hers and I sat down. Across the club, Keith was still talking to one of the girls whose table heâ€™d almost upended. As I watched, he picked up a napkin and tried to pat her down with it.</p>

<p>â€œDonâ€™t sweat it,â€ Rylie said. â€œWhatever it was that made Jake send him flying like that, Iâ€™m sure Keith deserved it.â€</p>

<p>I turned to her. â€œYou saw that, huh?â€</p>

<p>She pulled the straw partway out of her drink and stabbed it back down into the ice. â€œThe other day at the guysâ€™ rehearsal Keith told me I had a nice set. Can you believe it? He just came right out and said that. In front of Caleb and everybody!â€</p>

<p>Across the table, Shane snickered, and Rylie smacked his arm.</p>

<p>â€œA nice set of what?â€ I said, confused.</p>

<p>She looked at me over her glasses. â€œWhat do you think?â€</p>

<p>â€œOh,â€ I said and giggled although I knew I probably shouldnâ€™t.</p>

<p>â€œYeah, ha, ha,â€ she said as I tried to stifle my smile. â€œSexual harassment is so hilarious. Youâ€™re just as bad as Caleb. You know what he said to me when I complained to him about Keith? Well, heâ€™s not wrong, babe, you do have a nice set.â€</p>

<p>Shane and I both burst out laughing.</p>

<p>Rylie flapped her hands at us. â€œScrew you guys! At least Jakeâ€™s got some sense of propriety. After that classy little comment he seemed about ready to bust Keithâ€™s jaw for him.â€</p>

<p>â€œYeah, well, thatâ€™s Jake for you,â€ Shane smiled softly. â€œA real stand-up guy. Hey, whereâ€™s Lia?â€ he wondered as I unzipped my backpack and started taking things out of it. â€œIs she singing tonight?â€ Now that Impressionable Youth was defunct, Lia sang lead for this other band called The Grubby Mitts.</p>

<p>â€œNot tonight,â€ I said. â€œSheâ€™s with Jonathan. Helping him film a horror short for some movie-making contest he wants to enter.â€</p>

<p>Rylie flicked on my flashlight and held the beam under her chin. Her glasses cast a shadow on her forehead, giving her a ghostly unibrow. â€œAnd I suppose Liaâ€™s the leading lady of this aforementioned masterpiece?â€</p>

<p>â€œBut of course,â€ I said. â€œI think sheâ€™s also half the crew. Sheâ€™s been so busy helping Jonathan prep costumes and props and stuff, it feels like Iâ€™ve hardly seen her these past few weeks. Thatâ€™s why she asked me to take pictures of the band for her tonightâ€¦Oh, crap!!â€ I clapped my hand over my mouth.</p>

<p>â€œWhatâ€™s the matter?â€ Shane, startled by my outburst, dropped the paper coaster heâ€™d been picking into shreds.</p>

<p>â€œLiaâ€™s camera,â€ I groaned. â€œI forgot to bring it with me!â€</p>

<p>Shane and Rylie looked at one another and then at me, as if trying to figure out what the big deal was.</p>

<p>â€œSheâ€™s going to flip when she finds out I didnâ€™t get any pictures tonight,â€ I explained. â€œSheâ€™s already been griping that I donâ€™t take The Blank Slate seriously anymore and now I go and do something like thisâ€¦ugh, I canâ€™t believe it!â€</p>

<p>Rylie flicked the flashlight off. â€œWhy would she think you donâ€™t take the zine seriously anymore?â€</p>

<p>I slumped in my seat as I recalled the withering look Lia had shot at me from behind her desk at Blank Slate headquartersâ€”a.k.a., her bedroom at her parentsâ€™ houseâ€”a couple of weeks ago. â€œVee,â€ sheâ€™d reprimanded me, â€œwhat kind of garbage is this? I mean, are you trying to make me regurgitate my Corn Pops here or what?â€</p>

<p>â€œWhatâ€™re you talking about?â€ Iâ€™d asked, pausing in the midst of a flagging campaign to dissuade her cat, Clyde 2, from using my calf as his personal scratching post. â€œWhatâ€™s wrong with my article?â€</p>

<p>Instead of answering Liaâ€™d tapped the typewritten pages Iâ€™d given her against her desk and held them up, laying her other hand over her heart. â€œThe audience stood, enraptured,â€ sheâ€™d read in a mockingly dramatic voice, â€œas guitarist Jake Mlinarich, drenched in sweat, his t-shirt clinging to his well-chiseled chest, crouched on the stage, holding the guitar between his legs. His biceps flexed and the veins stood out in his forearms while his fingers scaled nimbly up and down the fretboardâ€¦ughhhhâ€¦â€ sheâ€™d trailed off, pretending to gag as she tossed the pages onto her desk in disgust. â€œAm I reading a concert review here or a romance novel?â€</p>

<p>â€œWell, itâ€™s all true,â€ Iâ€™d defended. â€œJake looks great these days. Heâ€™s been lifting those weights in Calebâ€™s garage. And running with him in the mornings sometimes. I think heâ€™s been eating better, too, becauseâ€¦Okay, okay,â€ Iâ€™d finished when Liaâ€™d groaned and dropped her face into her hands, â€œIâ€™ll write it over.â€</p>

<p>â€œToo late,â€ sheâ€™d informed me. â€œThe new issue goes to press tomorrowâ€”as you well know. Your review will just have to wait until next month.â€</p>

<p>Iâ€™d thought about pointing out to her that there was no reason we couldnâ€™t postpone running the issue until the following week, seeing as how it was her zine and the two of us were in charge of everything related to it, but I knew it wouldnâ€™t do any good. Lia had this weird thing about punctuality. She was pretty hung up on all her little schedules and things. So instead Iâ€™d accepted my pages back from her and agreed to â€œtry and write at least a line or twoâ€ about something other than my â€œsick obsessionâ€ (her words) with â€œJake and his, ahem, instrument.â€</p>

<p>â€œJust trust me,â€ I told Rylie, frowning at the memory, â€œLiaâ€™s not going to be happy about this.â€</p>

<p>Rylie didnâ€™t seem to hear me. Her eyes had locked onto my necklace. â€œWow, is that Jakeâ€™s pick youâ€™re wearing?â€ She hooked her finger in the chain to get a better look.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d have answered her, but suddenly I was distracted, too. Iâ€™d just spotted a short redhead with glasses and about twenty earrings punched through one earlobe slithering through the crowd, straight toward the front of the club. Annalise, I thought, prickling with resentment. Or maybe her name was Annabel. I could never remember. All I knew for certain was that she was Jakeâ€™s ex-girlfriend and theyâ€™d broken up years ago, but with the way sheâ€™d been turning up at all his shows lately and hanging around near the stage trying to catch his attention, youâ€™d think sheâ€™d never gotten the memo. I couldnâ€™t believe she was here again tonight.</p>

<p>â€œOoh, how adorable!â€ Rylie squealed when she discovered the initials on my new medallion.</p>

<p>â€œHey,â€ I said to her, â€œwhat do you know about Annalise?â€</p>

<p>â€œWho?â€</p>

<p>â€œOr Annabel. Whoever. The redhead,â€ I pointed. â€œWith the giant boobs and all the tattoos.â€</p>

<p>Rylie let the necklace drop and turned, adjusting her glasses as she searched the crowd. â€œAriella,â€ she corrected when she saw who I meant. â€œAriella Baker. She played in a band with Caleb in high school. Or junior high maybe, Iâ€™m not sureâ€¦â€ She pouted, trying to remember. â€œYou should ask Jake about her,â€ she finally said. â€œThey used to go out, you know.â€ I nodded vaguely, struggling to maintain a neutral facial expression, but Rylie didnâ€™t seem to notice. â€œI gotta hit the little girlsâ€™ before the show starts,â€ she announced. â€œWatch my drink? Donâ€™t let Shane slip a mickey into it or anything.â€ She slid off her bar stool, playfully squeezing Shaneâ€™s shoulder on her way to the bathroom.</p>

<p>Turning back to the stage, I saw Ariella had installed herself in the front row. She was barely dressed in a tiny plaid skirt and white tank top, with the lacy edges of her black bra peeking out through the armholes. Subtle, I thought. She turned, as if sheâ€™d felt me looking at her, and our gazes locked. Her eyes flickered for a second, like maybe sheâ€™d recognized me from the one time weâ€™d sort of met before. But then she frowned and I knew she hadnâ€™t. The houselights went down and a spotlight came up. I watched Taylor make his way to the microphone.</p>

<p>â€œHello, beautiful people!!â€ he called, wrapping his nail-polished hand around the microphone. His Dickies work shirt was unbuttoned, showing off his nipple rings and the tribal tattoo encircling his navel. He was tall and wiry like Jake, but a lot paler than him. He had clear blue eyes and beneath his beat up trucker hat, his longish blonde hair was practically white. Lia had once described him in the Slate as looking like â€œa punk rock ghost.â€</p>

<p>â€œWe are Good Television,â€ Taylor continued, â€œand believe-you-me, we are eager, eager, EAGER to play for you fine-looking folks too-NITE!â€</p>

<p>About half the audience whistled and cheered in response while the other half booed. An empty bottle arced through the air and smashed apart at Jakeâ€™s feet. He mouthed a curse, anger flashing in his eyes as he kicked the broken shards away from him, over the edge of the stage.</p>

<p>â€œHey, now,â€ Taylor patted at the air in a â€œcalm downâ€ motion. â€œWeâ€™ll have none of that!â€ He hopped up and down a few times. Behind him, Jake struck the first chord and the band launched into the only cover in their set, a radically sped up, punkish version of Led Zeppelinâ€™s â€œBlack Dog.â€</p>

<p>It didnâ€™t take long for the crowdâ€™s hostility to dissolve. By the time Good TV was halfway through their set, most everyone was cheering and raising their fists in the air. By the glow of my flashlight, I jotted down a quick account of the bandâ€™s triumph over the audience (no surprise to me) and then concentrated hard, trying to come up with somethingâ€”anythingâ€”to describe other than the rigid outline of Jakeâ€™s pecs beneath his already sweat-soaked t-shirt.</p>

<p>I was still chewing my lower lip and staring blankly at my notebook when a roar went up from the crowd. I looked up to see Keith thundering through the last bit of a song, rolling his drum sticks faster and faster before finishing with a massive clang of his cymbals. He stood up and chucked a stick into the audience. While people dove over one another to try and claim it, Jake flicked two guitar picks at the crowd, one right after the other. I didnâ€™t see where the first one ended up because it flew too far from the stage lights and was swallowed by the dark.</p>

<p>But the second one sailed right into Ariella Bakerâ€™s cleavage.</p>

<p>From my seat, I had a great view of it landing on her sweaty chest and sliding down into her tank top, threatening to disappear forever between those enormous boobs of hers. But then, at the last second, she fished it out and held it up, giving Jake this big, goofyâ€”but undeniably flirtatiousâ€”grin. I saw Jake smile, too, and my heart palpitated, not in a good way. Then Good TV launched into their next song.</p>
