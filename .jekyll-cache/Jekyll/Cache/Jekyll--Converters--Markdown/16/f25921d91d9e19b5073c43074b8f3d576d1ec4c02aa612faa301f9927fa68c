<p><a href="/novels/the-real-you/"><em>The Real You</em></a> and <a href="/novellas/a-very-merry-carreen-halloween/"><em>A Very Merry Carreen Halloween</em></a> are a couple of cute and lighthearted romances.</p>

<p>After publishing my 2nd book, <a href="/novels/fear-and-laundry-2/"><em>Fear and Laundry 2</em></a>, I had no intention of writing any more books set in Carreen, TX, at least not for a while. I spent a year working on a completely different project, but when NaNoWriMo 2015 rolled around, I decided to take a break from that new book and write something else.</p>

<p>I started from a few notes I’d made regarding the epilogue to <em>FaL 2</em>, and the character introduced there, named Rourke. I’d thought I might write a short story about her, but I wound up writing a full-length novel, which became <a href="/novels/the-real-you/"><em>The Real You</em></a>. Since it came together much faster than the other project I had been working on, I decided to concentrate on Rourke’s story, instead, for a while and then go ahead and put it out.</p>

<p>I loved writing <a href="/novels/the-real-you/"><em>The Real You</em></a> and I hope y’all enjoy reading it.</p>

<p><a href="/novellas/a-very-merry-carreen-halloween/"><em>A Very Merry Carreen Halloween</em></a> (which I’m so far referring to as a “Bonus Holiday Special”) takes place about 2+ years after the end of <a href="/novels/the-real-you/"><em>The Real You</em></a>. It features Rourke, Dallas, and a bunch of other characters from <em>The Real You</em>, as well as <a href="/connected/fear-and-laundry/"><em>Fear and Laundry</em> and <em>Fear and Laundry 2</em></a>. I have no idea if anyone will be interested in reading this (and, really, that is true of everything I’ve ever written in my life), but I wrote it anyway because:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I like Rourke and Dallas, they wouldn’t leave my mind, and I wanted to write a little more about them.</li>
  <li>I enjoy writing about holidays, and since Halloween is my favorite, I wanted to write a story set then.</li>
  <li>And yeah, I wanted to put the characters in funny costumes and send them off to a haunted house :D. Why not, I ask you?</li>
</ol>

<p>I hope at least some of y’all will check it out and get a kick out of it.</p>
