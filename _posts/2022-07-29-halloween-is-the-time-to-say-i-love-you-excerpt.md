### Chapter One

*Hillingham Hollow, a suburb of Houston, Texas*
*Friday, October 25th*

The weekend of Autumn Joy Alejandro's wedding, I experienced one of the most embarrassing moments of my life. At the time, I blamed her a little. Autumn Joy, I mean. After all, it was the latest news report about her nuptials that had distracted me so much, I'd allowed disaster to ensue.

I had to admit, later, though, that at least some of the trouble had been my fault. Had I left the house when I was supposed to that day—as soon as my duties were done for the morning—it's unlikely anything funny would've happened. Instead, there I'd been, hanging out in my client, Mrs. Rankin's, living room, watching television, completely oblivious to what my dawdling was about to cost me. I'd had the TV on in the background while I worked, and, now, before I left for home, I was taking a minute to watch the tail end of the local news report.

As they'd been all week, the anchors were chattering excitedly about the upcoming wedding festival. A slide show flashed across the screen, showing pictures of volunteers happily constructing carnival booths on Main Street, of the giant purple Christmas—sorry, I mean Halloween—tree dominating Town Square, and of the elegant, freshly-painted white gazebo in the park, where the wedding would take place Sunday night. I was gawking at these preparations rather wistfully. Even though I didn't know Autumn Joy personally (we'd gone to the same high school, but she'd graduated six years after I did), I couldn't help but be swept up in the romance of her situation. Once upon a time, I'd filled sketchbooks with designs for elaborate weddings such as hers. I'd thought I was going to be a big-time event coordinator. Like so much else in my life, though, that plan hadn't really worked out. Like, at all.

"Smoochie! Smoochie, stop it already! For goodness' sake..."

The plea, yelled in a distantly familiar masculine voice, tore my focus from the television. I heard frantic barking ringing from the front yard. Frowning, I clicked off the TV set, crossed to the front door, and swung it open. I stepped onto the porch and...I saw him.

Reese Mathis. He was standing on the sidewalk in front of the house, dressed in well-fitting jeans and a Deep Ellum Brewing t-shirt. Tall, dark-haired, and green-eyed, he was a thoroughly handsome specimen of manhood and a completely unexpected blast from my past, not to mention someone I was not at all prepared to deal with today. Or ever. I opened my eyes wide and took a step backward, intending to slink back inside Mrs. Rankin's house and shut the door until he went away, but it was too late. He had seen me.

"Jessye?" Surprise dawned on his face first, and then unmistakable gladness. His mouth split open in a grin. Dimples appeared in each of his cheeks. "Jessye, oh my goodness. Hi!" He waved. In his other hand, he held a leash, at the end of which, leaping up and down, wagging his tail madly, was a Jack Russell Terrier I recognized. I'd seen other people leading that dog around the neighborhood before, but never Reese. Certainly never Reese. If I'd seen him, I would've known not to come back to this house again, no matter how well the owners tipped.

Reese ripped his gaze away from me to frown at the dog. "Smoochie, for the love of...Would you calm down?"

The dog would not calm down. Especially not now that the next-door neighbor, Mr. Pedersen's, Calico, Betsy, had emerged from the rose bushes. The cat got one look at Smoochie, flattened her fluffy ears, and took off like a streak. I felt the breeze sweep past my legs as the feline dashed between the artificial jack-o-lanterns arranged on the porch and zoomed in the door I'd left standing open. Jack-o-lanterns tumbled like bowling pins in her wake. Smoochie went wild, bouncing and yapping as if the sky were coming down on him.

"Betsy, no!" I spun and darted in after her.

At the same time, Reese called out, "Smoochie! Smoochie, STOP!" Then, with an extra dose of panic, "Jessye, look out!!" I turned over my shoulder to see the dog had escaped him. Here the terrier came, barreling at me at top speed, his tongue flapping in the wind and his leash dragging behind him, whipping a furrow across the carefully cultivated lawn. I screeched and ducked aside. The remainder of the jack-o-lanterns toppled, and the dog went hurtling past.

A quarter second later, Reese pelted in the door. He stopped and looked around, wide-eyed. "Which way did he go?"

I pointed into the dining room. And then we both heard it: the terrific crash announcing something glass had just shattered into a bazillion pieces.

"Betsy!" I screamed, but the cat was already racing back toward me, all four paws leaving the carpet as she bounded for her life. She bolted past us, escaping out the front door. Smoochie was right behind, and would've happily given chase, but Reese crouched down and caught the frantic animal around the middle with both large hands. The impact bowled Reese onto his haunches and then spilled him onto his back, where he lay with the wriggling dog locked against his chest. He was cursing, making faces, while Smoochie lived up to his name, lapping his wet tongue all over Reese's neck and chin.

I stood and watched the unlikely scene for a moment, stupefied and confused. And then I couldn't help it any more—I doubled over and laughed. Hard.

"It's not that funny." The dark scowl clouding Reese's brow did nothing to diminish his attractiveness. Or my laughter.

"I'm s-sorry." I covered my mouth and batted my eyelashes, trying to blink away the tears. "You look...You look like a pig wrestler!"

"Yeah? Well, I feel like one, too." He cast Smoochie a thunderous look, and then, with a bit of muttering and wriggling, managed to regain his feet. He set Smoochie down, careful to wrap the pup's leash tightly around his hand. When the terrier's paws touched the carpet, it was as if a switch had flipped inside him. He ducked his head and acted subdued. That fretful expression on his snout worried me.

"Hey, is he okay?" I asked.

Reese bent, performing a brief examination of the dog. "Yes, he's fine. Just feeling guilty, I'd expect, which only serves him right...And, by the way, I'm also fine, ma'am. Thank you for asking."

I flapped a hand at him. "Please cool your heels, sir, I hadn't gotten around to asking about you yet."

"Right." And then, with a wary note, "I'm so sorry about this Jessye. Did he break something in here? It sounded like he broke something."

"Oh, no!" In my fit of laughter, I'd already forgotten about the ominous crash, but now I scurried into the dining room to inspect the damage. "It's one of the French doors," I discovered, spreading my hands in dismay.

The set of double doors leading onto the back deck were shut, and evidently one of the animals, probably Smoochie, since he was bigger, had hit them so hard, one of the bottom panels had busted out. Glass shards glittered on the deck, and also inside the house, dusting the floorboards. Floorboards I'd only recently finished waxing and polishing. No wonder Smoochie had found them so slippery. I took a moment to be thankful neither of the animals had seemed hurt, and then I felt my hands bunching into fists, galled to know my own hard work had contributed to this fiasco.

Reese came up beside me, letting out a mild curse when he saw the mess. "I'm so sorry," he said again.

"You ought to be." New tears stung my eyes, but these weren't from laughter. I was so screwed! I shoved Reese hard in the arm and then pressed my hand against my stomach, as if I could force down the storm of nausea welling inside me.

Reese looked at me in surprise. "Well, geez, I did apologize. And I will fix it for you, you know."

"Not for me!" I cried.

"What?"

"You won't fix it for me because this isn't my house! The Rankins live here."

"Who?"

"Mr. and Mrs. Rankin. My clients. Who are probably going to fire me when they see this. Oh, you have to get out of here!" I shoved him again.

"Now, hang on just a second." He planted his feet. "This is my fault. I'll take care of it."

"No, you won't. You'll only make things worse. If Mrs. Rankin comes home and finds you here, who knows what she'll think? Then I'll have to explain you, too. Ugh...Look, just go, please. She only stepped out to run an errand, and she'll be back any minute. I have to clean up that glass. Oh, man..." I was pacing up and down with the palm of one hand pressed against my forehead, struggling to decide the best way to handle this disaster.

Meanwhile, Reese wasn't going anywhere. He was set in place, his gaze traveling up and down the length of my body. I had the feeling he wasn't listening to a word I was saying anymore, only examining what I was wearing and what I looked like these days. I snapped my mouth closed and quit pacing. Embarrassment curdled my insides as I realized how I must appear to him. Scrawnier than I'd looked seven-plus years ago, surely, with a skinny, worried face and dark circles shadowing my brown eyes. My light chestnut hair, which had once been almost annoyingly massive, had thinned considerably and lost its luster. Chronic stress will do that to a person. I was grateful the kerchief tied over my head hid most of the evidence, even if the scrap of checkered fabric also made me look like a drudge.

No more so than your clothes do, I thought, touching my collar.

I was in my uniform, a light purple polo shirt and gray slacks, with a lighter purple smock overlaying the ensemble. My rubber-soled shoes were black and sensible, providing safety and comfort but no style. I caught Reese eyeballing my left hand. What was he doing? Checking for a ring? Or just staring at how red and raw my work-worn fingers were these days? I shoved my hands into the pockets of my smock, concealing a truth I had no desire to admit.

"What's going on?" Reese's eyes found mine again. His eyebrows pinched together, and he asked me the dreaded question. "If this isn't your house, then what're you doing—"

A car pulled into the driveway then, rolling over his words. I closed my eyes momentarily, not believing my bad luck, and when I opened them again, Reese was still standing there, looking gorgeous and perplexed—unwittingly about to ruin everything for me. "I don't imagine I can persuade you to leave out the back door?" I pleaded, casting him an imploring gaze.

He drew back his shoulders and frowned. "Not a chance."

No, of course not. Why make things easy for me?

"Don't worry," he added, holding out a conciliatory hand. "Just leave the talking to me. I'll take care of everything."

That was what I was afraid of. 

Outside, the car door creaked open and then slammed shut, and I heard feet shuffling. I stepped into the doorway between the living room and dining room to wait, pulse thudding in my throat. The next moment, Mrs. Rankin had whirled in the front door and tossed an armload of shopping bags on the sofa. She cocked her head, giving me a surprised look.

My client was an olive-skinned beauty who'd turned forty-one only a few months ago but was in excellent shape and looked about thirty. Her first husband had passed away tragically when she was young, I wasn't sure how, and her second one, who was only thirty-four now, had met her on a business trip to Guadalajara some five years ago. I'd worked for them for three years—first at their previous home, and now at this new one—and had been around the two of them enough times to confidently say they were happily married. Mr. Rankin was a handsome young man, quiet and pleasant, and Mrs. Rankin treated him like a king. She was exceedingly kind to me as well, although sometimes excitable.

"What's happening?" she demanded as she marched toward me. "Why front door is standing wide open and mis calabazas—my pumpkins—thrown everywhere? I thought you would be finished for today already, but—" She stopped, sucking in a breath when she reached me, looked past my shoulder, and saw the broken window pane. "Oh, no!! What happen?"

"I'm so sorry, Mrs. Rankin." I clasped my hands in front of my chest.

She gasped again. "This is bad. Very bad. Muy malo!" She pressed her hands to her pretty face, widening her large eyes. "I have party here in two days. This is why I have you come and do extra clean this morning!"

"Yes, I know. Like I said, I'm sorry. It's my fault. I left the door open for only a second and Mr. Pedersen's cat...Well, the cat...And then the dog—" I gestured at Smoochie.

"Now wait just a second." Reese took a step forward and held out his hand. "This is my fault. Ma'am—" He looked into Mrs. Rankin's eyes. "I was taking Smoochie here for his walk, and I let him get away from me. He chased a cat in here and broke your window. I'm truly sorry about all that, but it was an accident. I'll beg you to please remember that."

"Smoochie?" Mrs. Rankin blinked at the little dog, who now sat quietly on the rug, next to Reese's leg. His snout was raised in a lofty manner, and there was a dignified, almost affronted look in his liquid eyes, as if he could never have caused any of the trouble now being mentioned, and he didn't have a clue why Reese or I would stoop to accusing him of such. "That's Neighbor Allison's perrito." Mrs. Rankin pointed an authoritative red fingernail at him.

Surprise lit Reese's face. "Yes. Allison. That's right. Allison's my mother. She lives a few houses down from here. You know her?"

"Claro que sí. Nice lady. I meet her when Peter and I move in a few months ago. She bring us a strawberry pie. Delicioso. Since then, we talk now and then..." Mrs. Rankin brought her gaze up to meet Reese's again. Her eyes grew, and a happy light flickered across her expression. "Ohhh...You are el hijo, Reese! I hear much about you from your parents. Including how handsome you are. But your photos do not do you justice, it seems." She glanced at me. "Don't you think, Miss Jessye? He is very handsome! Muy guapo, eh?"

"Uh..." I glanced at Reese, and he snuck a wink at me. I snapped my mouth closed again and dropped my gaze.

I couldn't keep my eyes off him for long, though. As he and Mrs. Rankin continued their chat, I kept stealing glances at him from under my lashes. He looked the same as he had almost eight years ago, only...bigger. He wasn't much taller—he'd already topped six feet when I knew him—but his chest had broadened and his muscles had swelled. His dark hair was cut shorter than before, and the last bit of youthful softness had melted from his face. He looks all grown up, I thought, with a warm thrill spreading through my chest. Healthy, too, and strong, not only in body but in spirit.

And yes, he was still handsome, as Mrs. Rankin had pointed out. Muy guapo.

Lord almighty.

I swiped my hand across my forehead, collecting beads of sweat. 

"You live in Dallas, no? You come to visit your parents?" Mrs. Rankin seemed to have forgotten about the demolished window. Now, all she was interested in was Reese and his family.

"Yes, ma'am, that's one of the reasons I'm in town." Reese shifted his weight, settling one hand on his hip. I tried to ignore the way the move tugged his t-shirt to one side, tightening the fabric across his powerful chest. I tried not to stare at his fingers, either, but I couldn't help noticing they were bare. No wedding ring for him, either, then. Hmm. As if THAT could matter anymore, I chided myself. Not to you, Jessye Anne.

He and Mrs. Rankin exchanged more small talk, and then Reese tried to wrap things up by repeating, "Anyway, I was just out walking the dog for Mom when he caught sight of that cat, and..." He waved at the mess on the floor. "Well, this happened. Again, I apologize. And I can take care of it for you, of course. Within the next twenty-four hours, in fact."

"You can fix?" Mrs. Rankin gave a happy gasp. "And so quickly?"

"Yes, ma'am, it won't take but an hour at most. All I'll need to do is pick up a few supplies at the hardware store, and I can borrow Dad's tools to do the rest."

"Oh, right, your father." She nodded with enthusiasm. "Gabriel is handyman. He must have taught you."

"Everything he knows," Reese acknowledged. "I'll be honest with you, too: I've had to handle this sort of repair before. I may have tossed more than one baseball through a window in my youth." His smile was crooked, oozing charm.

Mrs. Rankin actually blushed under the onslaught. She turned to look at me. "Ai! I'm sorry, Miss Jessye, I do not introduce you two..."

"Ah, that's okay," I waved at her. "We, um...Reese and I, we...met already—"

"We go way back, Jessye and I." Reese grinned. "You know, from when I still lived here. When we were younger."

Mrs. Rankin looked from one to the other of us. She clapped her hands and gushed, "Que lindo! Y maravilloso. Jessye can help you fix, then."

"What?" I said.
"The window. You fix window! Both of you together!" She gestured at the broken door and then between me and Reese, waving as if attempting to force us closer together. "You work for me for a long time, Jessye. I trust you. I loan you key to my house, you can enter and help fix whenever ready. Easier on me." She touched her breastbone. "I have very much to do today and cannot sit around esperando..."

My stomach did a slow pitch at the idea of being Reese's assistant for the afternoon, but I knew I couldn't turn her down. I was lucky she was being so nice about this debacle in the first place. "S-sure." I wiped my face again. "That's fine. I can c-come back and help." Since it was my fault, anyway. Or it was Autumn Joy's, for planning such a captivating wedding and broadcasting the details on TV. Argh.

Mrs. Rankin beamed. Reese beamed. I couldn't beam. I gave them each a sickly smile and then, gripped by an urgent need to get away from them both, I turned on my heel and hastened for the front door.

"Hey, where you going?" Reese asked.

"To get my broom and dustpan," I murmured, "so I can sweep up that broken glass." I could feel him staring hard at me as I passed him by, trying to get me to look at him, but I didn't. I kept my head ducked as I hurried away.

### Chapter Two

The housecleaning franchise I worked for, Hey! It's Clean!, was a decent employer. They paid above-average wages, kept their maids supplied with the most up-to-date equipment and non-toxic, organic cleaning products, and they didn't micro-manage us. My only complaint was that they required their employees to tool around town in these ugly, company-owned four-door hatchbacks. The vehicles were serviceable but not exactly...subtle. They were royal purple, with huge, blown-up photographs of smiling maids wrapped around both sides. I walked out to mine, carrying my broom and dustpan in a shaking hand. I'd just swept up the glass in Mrs. Rankin's dining room, and now I was dreaming of ducking into the car and escaping before Reese could catch me and start firing off more questions about what I was doing here. Although the answer should've been obvious by now, given the uniform I was wearing, and Mrs. Rankin saying she'd hired me to clean her house before her party on Sunday night.

Yes, that's right, Reese, I imagined myself saying to him, I'm a maid now. I scrub toilets for a living. Are you surprised? I know I am.

It was true, I'd never aspired to be a house cleaner, but I wasn't ashamed of how I earned a paycheck. Cleaning houses was honest work, and, like I said, the pay was decent. But regardless of how I felt about my job, I knew other people looked down on it. I doubted Reese would be one of those people, but how did I know? I hadn't talked to him in ages. Maybe, over the years, he'd morphed into a super-snob. Either way, I didn't look forward to hashing through the details of my latest "career move" with him. Doing so would necessitate admitting the humiliating reasons I'd ended up here, on what many people considered the lowest rung of the societal ladder.

Unfortunately, I couldn't just dive into the hatchback and disappear. I'd promised to come back later today and help Reese fix Mrs. Rankin's broken French door. I was going to have to talk to him again. We were going to have to spend time—at least an hour, he'd said!—together. Lord, help me.

"Jessye? Jessye, you're not running off, are you? Wait up." Reese's voice, carrying from the front porch, was just as low-pitched and manly as I remembered, and the rich timbre struck a chord of longing deep within me.

I closed the car door and turned around. My stomach seemed to be folding itself into origami as I watched him pause on the porch to right an overturned plastic jack-o-lantern and then hurry down the walk with Smoochie in tow.

Reese stopped when he reached me, cocking his head in question when I didn't say anything. Finally, he realized he was going to have to take the lead. "Hey, that was pretty crazy, huh? I'm so sorry. Smoochie's sorry, too. Aren't you, Smoochie? Aren't you sorry, boy?" He jingled the leash as if to prompt Smoochie to apologize.

I couldn't help but smile at the terrier, who was wagging his tail and grinning with pride, as if, instead of scolding him, Reese had just praised him as the best doggie in the universe.

"He sure looks sorry," I chuckled. "Anyway, it's alright. It was just an accident. Thanks for staying and talking to Mrs. Rankin about it."

"Yeah, of course. Told you I'd handle it. And to think, you wanted me to sneak away, instead." Reese transferred Smoochie's leash from one hand to the other. He shifted his weight so that his t-shirt stretched across his muscles again, and flames blazed to life under my skin. He really needed to quit doing that or I was going to sweat through my polo shirt. "I think I smoothed things over pretty well with her," he continued, congratulating himself.

"Uh, yeah," I said. "You charmed her, alright. If I didn't know for a fact that she's madly in love with Mr. Rankin, I'd think she was ready to run off with you, instead."

A pale blush glowed on Reese's cheeks, but his eyes sparkled. "Well. I don't know about that. I'm just glad she didn't seem too mad about the whole thing. I asked her to please not blame any of this on you, and she promised me you were in the clear."

"Oh. Thanks for that." I didn't know what else to say. I really was grateful for his intervention, considering it had turned out so well. Mrs. Rankin was one of my favorite clients, and I didn't want to lose her business. Nor could I afford to.

Reese flashed another big, happy grin. "Gosh, Jessye, it's so good to see you! Despite the chaos, this has made my whole day! You look amazing."

I wasn't sure whether to smile or frown at that comment. Was he making fun of me? "Yeah," I finally said. "I'm sure."

He drew a handkerchief out of his pocket and handed it to me. "You've, uh, got a little something on your face, there, though..."

"What?"

He tapped his cheekbone and then gestured at me.

I turned and peered at myself in the hatchback's side mirror. A blot of dirt blackened the side of my nose, and another smudge shadowed my left cheekbone. Sheesh, and those had been there the whole time?! Thanks for the heads-up, Mrs. Rankin. "Oh! Yuck." I scrubbed vigorously with the handkerchief until the dirt was gone. "I had to wrestle with the vacuum earlier," I explained, turning back to him. "It must've hiccupped some dust on me. Sorry. That's so gross."

Reese shrugged, unperturbed. He seemed unable to stop smiling. "When can I pick you up?" he asked.

"What?" Why did that seem to be the only word I was capable of saying to him?

"I have to take Smoochie home—and I assume you might have some other stuff to do, too—but whenever you're ready, I can come pick you up, and we can head to the hardware store. Margarita had a tape measure handy, so I measured the window already. We'll need to get the glass cut special, and I'll need to buy some glazing and maybe a few other things, but Dad should have everything else I need to get the job done. You've got the spare key, right? Margarita said she would lend it to you for the afternoon."

I arched my brows. Margarita, was it? I'd been working for the woman for three years, and she was still Mrs. Rankin to me.

"Yeah," I said, patting my smock, "she gave me the key. I have it."

"Great!" Reese's phone appeared in his hand. "Give me your address and let me know what time to come pick you up."

"Oh, but..." I paused, biting my lip.

"What's the matter?"

"Nothing. It's just..." It was just that I didn't want to tell him where I lived these days. It was a far cry from what he remembered. I could tell him to meet me back here later, maybe. But that might make it seem as if I didn't want to help him at the hardware store. Which would seem ungrateful, wouldn't it?

Crap.

"Jessye?" He was watching me with twinkling eyes, that same eager grin on his lips.

I sighed and then blurted out my address. "I need to go home and get cleaned up first, though. Obviously." I waved the handkerchief still in my hand. "But it shouldn't take too long. Come over around...three?"

He was typing my info into his contact list, nodding with excitement the whole time. "Yeah, yeah, I'll see you then. Can't wait. I'm pumped to catch up with you, hear what's been going on."

Smoochie, sensing Reese's elation, gave a gleeful bark and trotted around in a circle, and then sat on his haunches and grinned up at me.

"Uh-huh. Can't wait," I echoed—while inside, my pride shriveled to the size of a dog biscuit.
