Veronica Montez loves scary movies. Fake blood, guts, and machete-wielding maniacs don't scare her. Real life does.

Veronica dreads spending the rest of her life folding towels in the Crawford Hotel's creepy basement laundry, but she hasn't got a clue what else to do after graduation. Even if she did, her grades suck so bad that she'll be lucky to even make it out of high school.

In the meantime, her best friend Lia is demanding her help rescuing Lynch's, their favorite hangout, from financial ruin. Veronica would hate to see the grungy Laundromat-slash-rock venue go under, but the idea of performing with Lia's band in Lynch's upcoming fundraiser petrifies her. She's no rock star. She's never participated in a gig beyond writing about it for Lia's zine. And that's not to even mention Lia's additional plan to lure hometown punk hero, Clyde Kameron, to the benefit concert. Just the idea of trying to pull off that particularly harebrained scheme freaks Veronica out more than The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

Then Lia's brother Jake unexpectedly returns to town from college. Veronica bonds with the gifted but temperamental guitarist over their affinity for gory flicks and soon discovers he's as ambivalent about his future as she is. Talk about terrifying. If someone as smart and talented as Jake can't figure things out, what hope does Veronica have?

Really Liking Jake scares her, too, although she can't decide if she's more afraid that he won't like her back, or that he will. Veronica's exes were only ever interested in fooling around. Something tells her Jake would want more from her. A whole lot more.

And while movie monsters might not faze her, the thought of risking her heart in a real relationship sends serious chills up Veronica's spine.
