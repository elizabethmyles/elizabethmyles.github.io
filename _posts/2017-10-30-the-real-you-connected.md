## The Real You (1 Novel + 1 Novella)

[*The Real You*][tru] and [*A Very Merry Carreen Halloween*][vmch] are a couple of cute and lighthearted romances.

After publishing my 2nd book, [*Fear and Laundry 2*][fal2], I had no intention of writing any more books set in Carreen, TX, at least not for a while. I spent a year working on a completely different project, but when NaNoWriMo 2015 rolled around, I decided to take a break from that new book and write something else.

I started from a few notes I'd made regarding the epilogue to *FaL 2*, and the character introduced there, named Rourke. I'd thought I might write a short story about her, but I wound up writing a full-length novel, which became [*The Real You*][tru]. Since it came together much faster than the other project I had been working on, I decided to concentrate on Rourke's story, instead, for a while and then go ahead and put it out.

I loved writing [*The Real You*][tru] and I hope y'all enjoy reading it.

[*A Very Merry Carreen Halloween*][vmch] (which I'm so far referring to as a "Bonus Holiday Special") takes place about 2+ years after the end of [*The Real You*][tru]. It features Rourke, Dallas, and a bunch of other characters from *The Real You*, as well as [*Fear and Laundry* and *Fear and Laundry 2*][fal-connected]. I have no idea if anyone will be interested in reading this (and, really, that is true of everything I've ever written in my life), but I wrote it anyway because:

1. I like Rourke and Dallas, they wouldn't leave my mind, and I wanted to write a little more about them.
2. I enjoy writing about holidays, and since Halloween is my favorite, I wanted to write a story set then.
3. And yeah, I wanted to put the characters in funny costumes and send them off to a haunted house :D. Why not, I ask you?

I hope at least some of y'all will check it out and get a kick out of it.
