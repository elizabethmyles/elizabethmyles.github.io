**Classic horror movies, rock music, VHS tapes, zines, and cassettes...let the teen romance of *Fear and Laundry* take you back to the '90s.**

It's 1994, and seventeen-year-old Veronica Montez has a few things she needs to get done fast:

- Take plenty of rad pictures for the next issue of her best friend's zine.
- Learn how to play drums so she doesn't embarrass herself in front of everyone at her new bandâ€™s upcoming first gig.
- Keep her grades above a C average so she can actually graduate from high school on time.
- Get over her hopeless crush on her best friend's sexy, super talented, guitar-playing older brother.
- And, oh, yeah...figure out what to do with the rest of her entire life.

Something tells her a few of these tasks might prove more difficult than the others.

This collection of *Fear and Laundry* includes books [one][fal] and [two][fal2] in their entirety.

**Reader advisory:** rated PG-13 for strong language, underage drinking, and sensuality.
