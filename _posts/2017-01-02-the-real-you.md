## The Real You

**Her best friend is the hottest guy in school...**

Rourke hasn't been in the same room with Dallas since she was eight years old. Since moving
away from her hometown nearly a decade ago, she's had to stay in touch with him solely online, where
the pair has grown closer than ever sharing everything from their favorite sci-fi shows to cute photos of
baby animals, to crises that have cropped up in each of their personal lives as they've grown up. Now
Rourke is suddenly back in town, and while she's thrilled to be reunited with the boy who has become
her dearest friend, she realizes it won't be easy seeing him in person again every day. Because over the
years, Rourke has fallen deeply in love with Dallas...but Dallas isn't the sort of guy who falls in love.

As the high school's resident drama heartthrob, Dallas is known for his passionate starring
performances. Unfortunately his Romeo act isn't only confined to the boards. Off-stage he's so popular
with the opposite sex that other guys come to him for advice on how to succeed with girls. Although
Rourke knows there's a lot more to him than the charismatic playboy everyone else sees, she still doubts
Dallas could ever be satisfied with only one girl, especially not one as bookish and old-fashioned as
herself. She knows the smart thing to do would be to get over Dallas and fall for someone more suitable,
or else resign herself to only finding happily-ever- after within the pages of her favorite romance novels.
But if it was hard enough for Rourke to keep from fixating on her charming pal when he was hundreds of
miles away, now that she's living right down the street from him again it seems downright impossible.
Especially with Dallas sending her so many strangely mixed messages concerning his own feelings about
*her*...
