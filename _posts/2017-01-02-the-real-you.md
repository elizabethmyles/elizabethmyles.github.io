When she was eight, Rourke moved away from her hometown and left her best friend, Dallas, behind. But thanks to the internet, they’ve stayed in touch—and grown closer than ever, sharing jokes, memes, and one personal crisis after another.

Now it’s senior year, and Rourke is suddenly back in town. And while she’s thrilled to reunite with Dallas, she realizes it won’t be easy seeing him in person again every day. Because over the years, she’s completely fallen for him…but she’s convinced he can never return her feelings.

As his high school’s resident drama heartthrob, Dallas is known for his passionate starring performances. Unfortunately, his Romeo act isn’t only confined to the boards. Off-stage, he’s so successful with girls that other guys come to him for lessons.

Although Rourke knows there’s a lot more to Dallas than the charismatic, seemingly carefree playboy everyone else sees, she still doubts he could ever be satisfied with only one girl, especially not one as bookish and old-fashioned as herself.

Rourke longs for true love, marriage, and a family someday, and she knows the smart thing to do would be to get over Dallas and move on to a guy who shares her hopes and dreams—or else resign herself to only finding happily-ever-after within the pages of her favorite romance novels.

But if Rourke found her best pal’s charms difficult to resist when there were hundreds of miles separating the two of them, now that she’s living right down the street from him again, it seems downright impossible. Especially with Dallas sending her so many strangely mixed messages concerning his feelings for *her*...
