### 3 novels + Bonus Content

**[Collection][collection] available now!**

[*The Sharpest Kiss*][tsk] and [*Back to Bite You*][btby] are a two volume low-angst, non-epic paranormal romantic comedy featuring vampires.  

This pair of short novels contain parts one and two of a complete story (although part one can be read as a stand-alone). They feature a cast of young characters (early to late twenties) living in the Houston suburbs when their normal, everyday existences are rudely intruded upon by a vicious member of the undead.

I don't know about you, but I personally enjoy all different varieties of romance novels and vampire books. These books in particular, I would characterize as "New Adult Paranormal Romantic Comedies," or maybe "Romantic Horror Comedies." Theyâ€™re fun, light-hearted stories intended to be fairly quick reads, and which will hopefully entertain you, warm your heart, and leave a smile on your face.

[*Yesterday's Demon*][yd] is a stand-alone novel that follows [*The Sharpest Kiss*][tsk] and [*Back to Bite You*][btby].
