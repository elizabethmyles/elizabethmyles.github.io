The following excerpt is from [*All I Want for Halloween Is You*]({{ page.about }}), coming June 28, 2022 and available for pre-order now!

### Chapter One

*The Acray-Sys Software campus in Vintage Meadow Lake, a suburb of Houston, Texas* 

*Friday, October 25th*

If ever there were a time I wished I'd been born a year later, it was after I'd read that article in Hollow Happenings about Autumn Joy Alejandro's wedding.

I mean, yeah, sure, having been born later would mean I was now only twenty years old instead of twenty-one, and there'd be places I couldn't go and things I couldn't drink yet, but it would also mean I'd probably have graduated from Hillingham High School with Joy and gotten a free ticket to see my favorite band of all time, How to Make a Wolf Howl.

Instead, I'd graduated the year before Joy, and, while I knew her well enough to say 'hey,' I hadn't been invited to her wedding and reception and—most importantly—The Big Concert. Not that I could blame Joy for failing to invite everyone she knew. That was a heck of a lot of people, and while Joy's father and fiancé were both filthy rich, even they were limited in how much they could shell out for a single party. Alejandro III and Covarrubias were already paying for about six hundred lucky boys and girls—everyone in Joy's graduating class, plus their guest—to go to the show. The rest of us would have to make do with the carnival on Main Street and the free concerts in the park on Friday and Saturday nights. Unless we could somehow finagle another way into the show on Sunday.

And believe me, I'd been working on that.

How to Make a Wolf Howl's record label had released a few thousand tickets to the public, but those had been snatched up quicker than anyone could shout "scalper." Three different radio stations had also hosted giveaways, all of which I'd faithfully entered...and failed to win. I'd been stalking StubHub every day since then for a ticket I might be able to afford, but with all my credit cards so close to being maxed out, there was just no way. It was beginning to look as if I were SOL, destined to spend the weekend at home, nursing my sick roommate, Pauline, along with my disappointed heart. At least until Pauline recovered from her bug and went to the wedding, like she was bound and determined to do. Pauline, who was my age and had gone to a different high school altogether, knew Joy even less well than I did, but the romance of the whole affair had gone straight to her head.

"This is probably the closest any of us will ever come to attending a royal wedding, Iris!" she'd exclaimed to me after she'd heard about the ceremony. Repeatedly.

I guessed she was right. All I knew was that, while she was freaking out about the nuptials, I was obsessing about getting myself into that concert. The closer the night of the show crept, the more fixated on it I became, to the point where, on Friday morning—roughly fifty-six hours before the Civic Center doors were scheduled to be thrown open for the show—I'd gotten so distracted, I'd completely botched something on a work project. Nothing major, really, just a small mistake—an email I'd forgotten to send—but nevertheless...important. According to my boss, "fundamentally important."

Oops.  

"Ms. Vega? If you would sign here, please...Ms. Vega?"

"Hm?" I glanced away from the bay window of the corner office—outside of which all I could see were more generic, square white buildings identical to the one in which I was currently sitting—to find the HR lady staring at me with tired eyes. She was leaning across her desk, holding out a pen, and from the expectant look on her face, she was waiting for me to do something.

"Um, I'm sorry." I swallowed, fidgeting with the name badge clipped to my lanyard. "But, what'd you say?"

She huffed out a breath and pointed with her pen. "I need you to sign this form, to confirm you've understood what we've discussed here today. You do understand it, don't you, Ms. Vega?"

I glanced at the sheet of paper she wanted me to sign. The top corner displayed the familiar Acray-Sys Software logo, and underneath that were printed my name and title: Iris Vega, New Products Intern. Below that sat a block of typewritten text. Angry text. My supervisor's latest litany of complaints about me. A few phrases stood out more starkly than others: "missed deadline," "forgot to send," "SECOND time," "EXTREMELY disappointing." The paper was bright yellow, which meant it was my second official warning about being a total screw-up.

Only one more to go, I thought, holding my breath. One more strike, and I was probably out of here for good, if not ousted from Acray-Sys itself, then at least out of the New Products department. If I was lucky, maybe they'd only bump me down to the mail room. My lips twitched at that thought. My parents would love it. They'd spent all that money on my education, and now here I was, a blink away from washing out of my very first internship. Commendable, Iris, highly commendable. All of Mom and Dad's friends would be pea-green with envy.

"Yes, I understand." My voice was meek and guilty as I accepted the pen from the HR lady and scribbled down my name. "If I screw up again, I'm out on my—"

The HR lady, who had curly, graying hair and whose name, according to the nameplate on her desk, was Suze Porter, gave me a sharp look.

"Well," I course-corrected, "I might lose my internship."

Suze sat back. Her gaze was a hint softer as she regarded me. "I'm confident that won't happen, Ms. Vega, as long as you can keep your attention more focused from now on. I'm sure you can do that, can't you?"

"Yeah. Sure, I can. Thanks." I slid the write-up across the desk to her and stood up, straightening my pencil skirt.

"Try and have a nice afternoon," she advised as I left.

"Thanks, Suze, you too."

I tottered on my high heels to the elevator bank, where I pushed the Down button and stood back to wait. The polished steel doors showed me my reflection: long, dark hair and coppery skin, a well put together outfit that looked perfectly professional. My large brown eyes, however, looked young and vulnerable in my worried face, brimming with anxious tears. Not professional in the least.

*No, no, no,* I chanted silently as my vision began to blur, *don't you cry, Iris. You can't cry at work! What would Dad say?*

The elevator doors slid open, and, thank goodness, the car was empty. I stumbled inside and mashed the number for my floor, followed by the Close Doors button about twenty times. When the doors finally shut, I leaned against the wall and dragged in a deep breath. I held my eyes open wide and fanned my face furiously. By the time I'd reached my floor, my eyeballs had stopped stinging, and I felt more confident about holding back the waterworks. Still, I kept my head ducked as I hurried back to my department, so no one would see the defeated look on my face.

When I neared my cubicle, my footsteps slowed. There were about fifty things pinned to my task list for this afternoon, and if I'd known what was good for me, I'd have collapsed into my chair in front of my pair of giant monitors and dived right into one of them, rather than risk another tongue lashing for slacking off. But after what'd just happened to me, I knew I was in no frame of mind to tackle anything new. My thoughts were too scattered. I needed at least one good, strong cup of coffee in me first. Yeah, just one cup to rein in my focus, and then I could come back here and whip through the afternoon's assignments like a boss. I veered away from my cube and scurried down the hallway, instead.

A few people loitered at tables in the breakroom, clicking away at laptops and thumbing through their cell phones. I ignored everyone and headed for the stepladder leaning in a corner. I dragged the ladder in front of the coffee cup cabinet and climbed up. Objectively, the shelf wasn't high, but to me, pretty much everything was a stretch. I was five-foot-four and a quarter...if I happened to be wearing two-inch heels.

I swung open the cabinet door and peered inside, searching for my cup. When I found it, I narrowed my eyes. Great. Someone had pushed my mug all the way to the back again. Talk about a stretch. Thanks, guys. I sighed and pushed up on my toes, extending one hand as far as it would go.

After a few fruitless passes, I managed to hook one finger over the lip of my mug and scrape it forward a few inches. At the same time, I felt the stepladder wobble under me. Fear clenched my stomach, and I dropped back onto my heels to steady myself. As my hand jerked back, the mug tipped over, spun toward me on its side—and dropped out of the cabinet. I grabbed for it and missed.

A long, horrified gasp hissed out of me as I watched the mug tumble through the air. Right when I was sure I was about to watch it shatter to smithereens, someone else's much longer arm swiped out in front of me and accomplished what I couldn't.

I watched, startled and fascinated, as the mug's rescuer clutched it in one large hand, holding it up to me like an offering.

"Whoa," I breathed, gathering the cup from him with an appreciative grin. "Nice reflexes. Thank you!"

"You're welcome, Iris."

For a moment, I simply stared at the mug, miraculously intact, in my grip and felt flooded with gratitude that it hadn't fallen. I knew if it had hit the counter or the tile floor from this height, it would have been done for—and also that I would have been devastated. I loved this mug; it was a souvenir from Fouke, Arkansas, with the words "I Want to Believe," printed under a likeness of the Boggy Creek Monster. I'd bought the cup on eBay, from a guy who lived in Fouke. It was the only mug like it I had ever seen online, and I had no idea where I would ever get another one if I lost it. Unless maybe I trekked out to Fouke myself and purchased one from their Monster Mart. Making a trip like that was one of my dreams, but given how dirt poor I was—and how much debt I would probably be in for the next seven decades or so—it was unlikely to ever come true.

I turned my wide-open eyes to the person who'd rescued my mug, prepared to thank him again, but the words stalled on my lips. He'd used my name, so I'd expected to know him, but I had no idea who he was. He had an I.D. badge clipped to his belt, but it was turned around so I couldn't read the name on it. I glanced at my own badge and saw it had gotten flipped around, too.

"Hey. How'd you know my name?" I blurted out.

The guy's brows knit together, as though the question confused him. "You've worked here for over six months. You're an intern for Tanesha Rosenthal in New Products."

I felt my eyelashes swishing rapidly. "Yeah. That's right. I've worked here for over six months." And yet I have no earthly idea who you are.

I climbed down the stepladder and looked him over again, wracking my brain to try and place him, but nothing clicked. If I'd ever met this guy before, I didn't recognize him. Probably because there was nothing remarkable about him. He could've been anywhere from twenty-five to thirty-five years old, had dull brown hair and drab brown eyes, and the same pasty-white computer tan most of the other guys in the office sported. He dressed the same as all of them, too, in dark slacks, a white dress shirt, and dark tie. The only things that really stood out about him were his black-framed glasses—which were actually kinda stylish—and the fact that his clothes were messy. His tie looked as though he had knotted it in a hurry, and his shirt wasn't tucked in all the way. Also, his hair needed a trim and looked as though he hadn't brushed it this morning. Or this month. If you'd Googled the phrase "cubicle nerd," his picture likely would've popped up.

And yet...he had rescued my mug!

As far as I was currently concerned, that made him my freakin' hero.

I touched his sleeve, feeling new tears, this time of happy relief, spring to my eyes. "Thank you," I sniffed with a smile. "Thank you for saving my mug. It's my favorite. If it'd broken, I'm not sure what I would've done. After the horrible day I've had today...well, I probably would have had a breakdown, hahaha. You totally saved my sanity." I flashed him another big smile, gave his arm a little pat, and then let him go.

The stranger tilted his head, watching me without a flicker of emotion in those muddy brown eyes. A heartbeat passed, and then he turned on his heel and strode across the room.

A dubious feeling sprouted in my belly as I watched him go, wondering if I'd crossed a line with that impulsive arm-touch, maybe committed some kind of personal space infraction that would earn me another trip to Suze Porter's office that afternoon. But then the guy stopped near the door and opened a different cabinet. He brought out a box of Kleenex and strode back to me, holding out the tissues like a second offering.

"Oh," I said, understanding, "thank you." I snatched out a tissue to wipe my eyes. As I blotted my lashes, I smiled at my hero, but he only stood there, watching me. Saying nothing.

I snatched out a second tissue and blew my nose. "You know," I began as I turned aside to toss it into the trash, "you're very thoughtful..." I didn't finish because when I turned back, the guy had abandoned the tissue box on the counter and taken off. I watched, bewildered, as he disappeared out the breakroom door—never looking back.

### Chapter Two

**What's going on? Did you get written up?**

The message blinked in my chat box while I was trying to finish up a stupid report. It was from Roxanne, my friend who worked in Finance. I typed back,

How do you know about that?

**Roxanne:** *Please, you know how it is around here. Word spreads fast. Someone said they saw you going up to HR. Plus, Tanesha's been complaining about some email that didn't get sent on time. Dana said she's been given more of your work because you 'just can't seem to get your act together.'*

I rolled my eyes. Really. Well, Dana can just—

But of course I couldn't type what I was thinking. I deleted it and wrote,

*Everything's fine, Rox. I've got it under control.*

**Roxanne:** *Uh-huh.*

Jer and I can meet you in the lunch room in 5, if U want to commiserate.

I thought about it for maybe half a second before telling her I would be right there.

---

"It's not that big a deal, Iris." Jerry patted my shoulder. "It's not like Tanesha's going to fire you." He, Roxanne, and I were standing in a huddle in the corner of the empty lunchroom, where I'd filled them in on my latest debacle with my miserable boss. They'd already known most of it, thanks to the rumor mill. Which only made me feel worse, knowing everyone knew about my stupid mistakes.

"How do you know she won't fire me?" I demanded of my friend. "I'm still on probation. All I need is one more write-up, and Tanesha can let me go without batting an eyelash. There'll be nothing I can do about it. Nothing. And you know she'll refuse to give me a recommendation. Which means I'll never get another internship, much less a real job. I'll be a failure, Jerry, a complete and utter failure at the age of twenty-one!"

Jerry's eyes bugged in response to my outburst, and his lower lip pushed out. "Look, all I'm saying...I think you're overreacting."

I glared at him.

Roxanne glared at him, too.

Jerry held up his hands in surrender. "Never mind. I don't know what I'm talking about. Your reaction is perfectly calibrated to the situation, Iris. The sky is falling! The sky is falling!"

I sighed and edged past him and Roxanne, pulling out a chair at one of the tables and dropping into it. I laid down my phone where I could see it, so I'd know if my boss sent me any new messages. The last thing I needed was to miss out on something else Tanesha considered a number one priority. Roxanne and Jerry both hurried over and sat across from me.

"Don't listen to him, Iris." Roxanne hooked her thumb at Jerry. "Like he said, he doesn't know what he's talking about. He has no idea how to comfort a person."

"That's true, I don't." Jerry nodded. "Just ask Marianne."

"Your poor, poor wife," Roxanne sighed at him. "I don't know how she's managed with you for, what is it, now? Twelve years?"

"Fourteen," he said, as if he couldn't believe it, either. "And I agree, the woman's a saint." He pressed his hands together in supplication.

I shook my head at both of them and sighed, "No, Jer's right, Rox. I am overreacting. And this write-up was totally my fault, too. I've just been so distracted lately—and it isn't even over anything that important. Not to anyone but me, anyway."

Roxanne fixed her gray eyes on me. "Are you talking about that How to Make a Werewolf show again?"

"It's How to Make a Wolf Howl," I corrected, "but yes. I know it seems frivolous, but they've been such a huge influence on me. I know everyone says stuff like this, but in my case, it's true:  they practically saved my life when I was a teenager."

"We know." Roxanne pursed her lips and gave a grave nod.

"Everyone knows." Jerry nodded, too, but his tone was flat, meant to discourage elaboration.

"Don't worry," I smirked at him, "I'm not going to tell y'all the story again."

Everyone who knew me at all was already well aware of my obsession with How to Make a Wolf Howl, and familiar with my reasons for adoring them. There was no use getting into it again. Suffice it to say, I'd been a fan since middle school, when Corvin Covarrubias had still been their guitarist. I felt as though I owed the band everything; the least I could do was show up on the one night they came to town and played together for the first time in nearly four years. Who knew if they would ever play again after this, or if they'd just go back on hiatus? Nothing official had been announced yet. For all I knew, this was my one and only chance to see them live, and, if I could swing it, I wouldn't even have to travel out of town for the show. I had to be there. I had to.

Jerry tapped his fingers on the table. "No luck getting a scalped ticket, then, I guess?"

I shook my head again. "They're astronomically out of my price range. Not that I even have a price range. These days, I'd basically have to skip a car payment to buy anything other than food."

I rested my elbows on the table and kneaded my temples. Just thinking about having to make these sorts of trade-offs depressed me, because I wasn't used to it. I hadn't always struggled with money. I'd grown up in an upper middle-class family, but after sending three kids through college, my parents could only afford so much. They paid for my tuition and rent, and gave me an allowance for work clothes, but I had to cover everything else on my own. Acray-Sys paid a decent wage, but I only worked there three days a week, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. In between, I attended classes at a University of Houston satellite in the neighborhood. Thanks to my online thrifting addiction, I was barely scraping by. I knew I had no one to blame for that but myself, but...usually my shopping bug wasn't much of a problem. If I'd known I was going to need the money to see How to Make a Wolf Howl, I'd have blocked eBay on my laptop and phone for the past few months. Or years.

Roxanne angled her head. "What about the guy you'd told me about, that you met in that fan forum-?"

I perked up, lifting my chin. "Oh, you mean Rod?"

"He said he had an extra ticket, right? You thought he might be willing to sell it to you at face value, and on some sort of payment plan?"

"Yeah, if I'd go to the festival with him. Which seems a small price to pay, honestly, since he's really cute in his pictures, but..."

Jerry was frowning. "But?"

"I haven't heard from him in over a week now. He stopped returning my messages." My shoulders slumped. "I'm guessing he found somebody else who'll pay him for the ticket up front, and/or give him a little extra for it on top. Those tickets are such hot commodities, I'm sure it wouldn't be difficult. Or maybe he just found some other girl he thinks is hotter than me to spend the weekend with him."

"Psh, that's not possible," Roxanne said dutifully.

I gave her a half-hearted smile.

"Buck up, Iris." Jerry patted my hand. "Something good will happen for you soon, I'm sure of it. It can't be bad news all the time, can it?"

His kindly tone and expression sent a flash of guilt through me. Aside from his wife, Marianne, Jerry also had four little kids to support, as well as a mortgage to pay off, and all kinds of other important responsibilities to manage. Compared to his, my life was carefree. "Yeah, I know," I told him. "Believe me, I realize what a whiner I'm being."

His eyes rounded. "No, Iris, that isn't what I meant."

"But it's true! I should be grateful for everything I've got, instead of focusing on the one thing I can't have. This is only a concert. Besides, you're right. There's always something good to focus on..." I sighed and stared at the wall, tapping my fingers as I tried to think of something positive. My mouth lifted at the corners. "Like the fact that my mug didn't get smashed earlier," I decided.

Roxanne frowned, alarmed. "What's that mean? Your mug? You mean, like, your face-? Did Tanesha threaten you?"

"What? No," I laughed. "That would've been a whole other kind of visit to HR. I'm talking about my coffee cup." I told her and Jerry about my encounter with the bashful guy in the break room, and how he'd rescued my Boggy Creek Monster mug from certain doom. "I know it was only a little thing," I said, flicking my wrist, "but his being so nice to me did help my mood a lot...Say, you two wouldn't happen to know who this guy is, would you? I don't think I've ever seen him before."

Jerry said, "Maybe. What's he look like?"

I shrugged. "Not to be mean, but...nothing special. Brown hair, brown eyes. Black glasses."

"Tall?"

"Yeah," I said, "decently tall." Then again, everyone seemed tall to me. "Why? Does that sound familiar?"

Jerry crossed his arms. "Kind of sounds like Clark Raybourn."

"Who?" Roxanne asked.

"He works for Marcus Wu."

Roxanne's face crumpled with distaste. "Oh, you mean that creepy guy from Internal Accounting? Yuck."

"Rox," Jerry admonished.

"What?"

"Come on. The guy's quiet, but he's perfectly polite."

"Yeah, just like every serial killer you've ever heard of."

Jerry gave her a reproachful look, but she ignored him and turned back to me. "So, Iris, what'd this guy say to you, anyway?"

"What'd he say?" I echoed.

She nodded. "It must've been something smooth, to have made such an impression on you."

I almost laughed. "Actually, no. He didn't say much at all, he just sort of...looked at me for a while."

"He looked at you?"

"Yeah. He stared at me for a minute. And then he took off in a hurry, like I'd made him uncomfortable. Or maybe like he didn't know what to say or do next."

Roxanne cut a pointed glance at Jerry, one eyebrow arched. "See? Creepsville. That is not standard behavior."

I shook my head and smiled. "No, you guys, that came out wrong. The impression I had was that he was only trying to be helpful—" A text lit up my phone and interrupted me. I snatched up the cell and pored over the screen. Every muscle in my body went rigid. "Holy cow."

"What is it?" Roxanne's voice was stretched tight with concern. "Is it Tanesha?"

"No." A grin started on my lips. "So much better! You guys'll never believe it, but his ears must have been burning. This is from Rod!"

"The guy with the ticket?" Roxanne's eyes lit up, and my heart warmed in response. She was such a good friend. So was Jerry. They were both older than me, and neither of them gave a rat's butt about the Wolf Howl concert, but they both wanted me to get to go, because they knew how much it meant to me.

"Yes!" I cried. "He says he's still interested in taking me to the show! He'll sell me the ticket for the purchase price—on an installment plan—if I'll be his date for the weekend." I looked up from the phone to see Roxanne and Jerry both smiling along with me, but then, almost in perfect sync, their grins collapsed, and they exchanged a worried look. "What?" I asked. "What now?"

Jerry turned to me first, adopting a brotherly tone as he said, "You're sure he just means 'date,' right?"

"Yeah," Roxanne chimed in. "You're not getting yourself into anything...you're not prepared for?"

I wrinkled my nose and waved. "Oh, that. Yeah, I'm sure. I'd already told him not to expect me to jump into bed with him or anything. I was very clear about it." In fact, that was part of the reason I'd thought I'd never hear from him again.

I was aware my friends didn't look convinced yet, but I didn't have time to sit around and persuade them. "Sorry, guys," I said, already typing my reply to Rod as I stood up, "but I've got to let him know I'm still in. And then I've got to go finish up my reports and get the heck out of here. He said he wants to meet at Baskets' after work today around six, and then go to tonight's concert in the park. I have to go home and change!" YAY, I added in my mind, and executed a quick happy dance beside the table. Jerry had been right, after all; something good had been right around the corner for me.

Things were looking up.
