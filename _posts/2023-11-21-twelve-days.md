### A sweet, stand-alone Christmas romance, available at a special introductory price for a limited time

Starry-eyed college freshman Tali Torres must complete an intensive twelve day Christmas-themed video project for her internship at the community newspaper. At the same time, she’s intent on cleaning up her supervisor’s messy personal life before Christmas arrives. The workload is far too demanding for only one person, even someone as energetic and hard-working as Tali. Fortunately for her, twenty-one-year-old Paul Fleming, a handsome stranger only in town for the holidays, steps in to help.

The attraction between Tali and Paul is instant, but while Paul seems only interested in enjoying some commitment-free fun over the winter break, Tali has sworn off vacation romances and hopes for something longer-lasting. Will one of them change their mind?

*Content advisory:*  Twelve Days *is a kisses-only romance. The story includes discussions of cyber-harassment.*
