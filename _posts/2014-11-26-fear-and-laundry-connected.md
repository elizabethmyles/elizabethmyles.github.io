## Fear and Laundry (2 novels)

[*Fear and Laundry*][fal] and [*Fear and Laundry 2*][fal2] are a couple of cute and lighthearted YA romances (the first of which was honored as a notable entry in [*Shelf Unbound Magazine*][shelfunbound]â€™s [2013 Writing Competition for Best Independently Published Book][shelfunboundcomp]).

These novels share a setting and some characters with Elizabeth's [*The Real You* and its sequel][tru-connected].
