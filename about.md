## Elizabeth Myles

Elizabeth is a graduate of [Lone Star College-Tomball][lsc]{: target="_blank"} and the [University of Houston][uh]{: target="_blank"}.  Her prize-winning short fiction appeared several times 
in [*Inkling*][inkling] the Creative Arts Magazine of LSC-Tomball, and her previous novel, [*Fear and Laundry*][fal], was honored as a notable entry in the teen
